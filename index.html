      <p>1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</p>
      <p>1:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</p>
      <p>1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</p>
      <p>1:4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.</p>
      <p>1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.</p>
      <p>1:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.</p>
      <p>1:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.</p>
      <p>1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.</p>
      <p>1:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.</p>
      <p>1:10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.</p>
      <p>1:11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.</p>
      <p>1:12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.</p>
      <p>1:13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.</p>
      <p>1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:</p>
      <p>1:15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.</p>
      <p>1:16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.</p>
      <p>1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,</p>
      <p>1:18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.</p>
      <p>1:19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.</p>
      <p>1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.</p>
      <p>1:21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.</p>
      <p>1:22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.</p>
      <p>1:23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.</p>
      <p>1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.</p>
      <p>1:25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.</p>
      <p>1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</p>
      <p>1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</p>
      <p>1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</p>
      <p>1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.</p>
      <p>1:30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.</p>
      <p>1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.</p>

      <p>2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</p>
      <p>2:2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</p>
      <p>2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</p>
      <p>2:4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,</p>
      <p>2:5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.</p>
      <p>2:6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</p>
      <p>2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</p>
      <p>2:8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.</p>
      <p>2:9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</p>
      <p>2:10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.</p>
      <p>2:11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;</p>
      <p>2:12 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.</p>
      <p>2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.</p>
      <p>2:14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.</p>
      <p>2:15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</p>
      <p>2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:</p>
      <p>2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</p>
      <p>2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.</p>
      <p>2:19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.</p>
      <p>2:20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.</p>
      <p>2:21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;</p>
      <p>2:22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</p>
      <p>2:23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</p>
      <p>2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</p>
      <p>2:25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</p>

      <p>3:1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? </p>
      <p>3:2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:</p>
      <p>3:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.</p>
      <p>3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:</p>
      <p>3:5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</p>
      <p>3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.</p>
      <p>3:7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</p>
      <p>3:8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.</p>
      <p>3:9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? </p>
      <p>3:10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.</p>
      <p>3:11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?</p>
      <p>3:12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</p>
      <p>3:13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</p>
      <p>3:14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:</p>
      <p>3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</p>
      <p>3:16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.</p>
      <p>3:17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;</p>
      <p>3:18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;</p>
      <p>3:19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.</p>
      <p>3:20 And Adam called his wife&rsquo;s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.</p>
      <p>3:21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.</p>
      <p>3:22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:</p>
      <p>3:23 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.</p>
      <p>3:24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</p>

      <p>4:1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.</p>
      <p>4:2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</p>
      <p>4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>4:4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:</p>
      <p>4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</p>
      <p>4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? </p>
      <p>4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</p>
      <p>4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</p>
      <p>4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother&rsquo;s keeper? </p>
      <p>4:10 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother&rsquo;s blood crieth unto me from the ground.</p>
      <p>4:11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother&rsquo;s blood from thy hand;</p>
      <p>4:12 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.</p>
      <p>4:13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.</p>
      <p>4:14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.</p>
      <p>4:15 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.</p>
      <p>4:16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</p>
      <p>4:17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.</p>
      <p>4:18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.</p>
      <p>4:19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</p>
      <p>4:20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.</p>
      <p>4:21 And his brother&rsquo;s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.</p>
      <p>4:22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.</p>
      <p>4:23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.</p>
      <p>4:24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</p>
      <p>4:25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.</p>
      <p>4:26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.</p>

      <p>6:1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,</p>
      <p>6:2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.</p>
      <p>6:3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.</p>
      <p>6:4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.</p>
      <p>6:5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</p>
      <p>6:6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.</p>
      <p>6:7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.</p>
      <p>6:8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.</p>
      <p>6:9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.</p>
      <p>6:10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</p>
      <p>6:11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.</p>
      <p>6:12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.</p>
      <p>6:13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.</p>
      <p>6:14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.</p>
      <p>6:15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.</p>
      <p>6:16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.</p>
      <p>6:17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.</p>
      <p>6:18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons&rsquo; wives with thee.</p>
      <p>6:19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.</p>
      <p>6:20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.</p>
      <p>6:21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.</p>

      <p>7:8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,</p>
      <p>7:9 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.</p>

      <p>7:12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.</p>
      <p>7:13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah&rsquo;s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;</p>
      <p>7:14 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.</p>
      <p>7:15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life.</p>
      <p>7:16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.</p>
      <p>7:17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.</p>
      <p>7:18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.</p>
      <p>7:19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.</p>
      <p>7:20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.</p>
      <p>7:21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:</p>
      <p>7:22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.</p>
      <p>7:23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.</p>

      <p>8:10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;</p>
      <p>8:11 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.</p>
      <p>8:12 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.</p>
      <p>8:13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.</p>
      <p>8:14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.</p>
      <p>8:15 And God spake unto Noah, saying,</p>
      <p>8:16 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons&rsquo; wives with thee.</p>
      <p>8:17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.</p>
      <p>8:18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons&rsquo; wives with him:</p>
      <p>8:19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.</p>
      <p>8:20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.</p>
      <p>8:21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man&rsquo;s sake; for the imagination of man&rsquo;s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.</p>
      <p>8:22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.</p>

      <p>9:1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.</p>
      <p>9:2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.</p>
      <p>9:3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.</p>
      <p>9:4 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.</p>
      <p>9:5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man&rsquo;s brother will I require the life of man.</p>
      <p>9:6 Whoso sheddeth man&rsquo;s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.</p>
      <p>9:7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.</p>
      <p>9:8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,</p>
      <p>9:9 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;</p>
      <p>9:10 And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.</p>
      <p>9:11 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.</p>
      <p>9:12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:</p>
      <p>9:13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.</p>
      <p>9:14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:</p>
      <p>9:15 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.</p>
      <p>9:16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.</p>
      <p>9:17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.</p>
      <p>9:18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.</p>
      <p>9:19 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.</p>
      <p>9:20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:</p>
      <p>9:21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.</p>
      <p>9:22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.</p>
      <p>9:23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father&rsquo;s nakedness.</p>
      <p>9:24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.</p>
      <p>9:25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.</p>
      <p>9:26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.</p>
      <p>9:27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.</p>
      <p>9:28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.</p>
      <p>9:29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.</p>

      <p>10:1 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.</p>
      <p>10:2 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.</p>
      <p>10:3 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.</p>
      <p>10:4 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.</p>
      <p>10:5 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.</p>
      <p>10:6 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.</p>
      <p>10:7 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.</p>
      <p>10:8 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.</p>
      <p>10:9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.</p>
      <p>10:10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.</p>
      <p>10:11 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,</p>
      <p>10:12 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.</p>
      <p>10:13 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,</p>
      <p>10:14 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.</p>
      <p>10:15 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,</p>
      <p>10:16 And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,</p>
      <p>10:17 And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,</p>
      <p>10:18 And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.</p>
      <p>10:19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.</p>
      <p>10:20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.</p>
      <p>10:21 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.</p>
      <p>10:22 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.</p>

      <p>11:1 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.</p>
      <p>11:2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.</p>
      <p>11:3 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.</p>
      <p>11:4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.</p>
      <p>11:5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.</p>
      <p>11:6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.</p>
      <p>11:7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another&rsquo;s speech.</p>
      <p>11:8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.</p>
      <p>11:9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.</p>
      <p>11:10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:</p>
      <p>11:11 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
      <p>11:12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:</p>
      <p>11:13 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
      <p>11:14 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:</p>
      <p>11:15 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
      <p>11:16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:</p>
      <p>11:17 And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
      <p>11:18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:</p>
      <p>11:19 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
      <p>11:20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:</p>
      <p>11:21 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
      <p>11:22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:</p>
      <p>11:23 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
      <p>11:24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:</p>
      <p>11:25 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
      <p>11:26 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.</p>
      <p>11:27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.</p>
      <p>11:28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.</p>
      <p>11:29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram&rsquo;s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor&rsquo;s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.</p>
      <p>11:30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.</p>
      <p>11:31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son&rsquo;s son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram&rsquo;s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.</p>

      <p>12:2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:</p>
      <p>12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.</p>
      <p>12:4 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.</p>
      <p>12:5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother&rsquo;s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.</p>
      <p>12:6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.</p>
      <p>12:7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.</p>
      <p>12:8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.</p>
      <p>12:9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.</p>
      <p>12:10 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.</p>
      <p>12:11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:</p>
      <p>12:12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.</p>
      <p>12:13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.</p>
      <p>12:14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.</p>
      <p>12:15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh&rsquo;s house.</p>
      <p>12:16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.</p>
      <p>12:17 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram&rsquo;s wife.</p>
      <p>12:18 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? </p>
      <p>12:19 Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.</p>
      <p>12:20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.</p>

      <p>13:3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;</p>
      <p>13:4 Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.</p>
      <p>13:5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.</p>
      <p>13:6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.</p>
      <p>13:7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram&rsquo;s cattle and the herdmen of Lot&rsquo;s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.</p>
      <p>13:8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.</p>
      <p>13:9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.</p>
      <p>13:10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.</p>
      <p>13:11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.</p>
      <p>13:12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.</p>
      <p>13:13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.</p>
      <p>13:14 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:</p>
      <p>13:15 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.</p>
      <p>13:16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.</p>
      <p>13:17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.</p>
      <p>13:18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.</p>

      <p>14:8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;</p>
      <p>14:9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.</p>
      <p>14:10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.</p>
      <p>14:11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.</p>
      <p>14:12 And they took Lot, Abram&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.</p>
      <p>14:13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.</p>
      <p>14:14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.</p>
      <p>14:15 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.</p>
      <p>14:16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.</p>
      <p>14:17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king&rsquo;s dale.</p>
      <p>14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.</p>
      <p>14:19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:</p>
      <p>14:20 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.</p>
      <p>14:21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.</p>
      <p>14:22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,</p>
      <p>14:23 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:</p>
      <p>14:24 Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.</p>

      <p>15:1 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.</p>
      <p>15:2 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?</p>
      <p>15:3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.</p>
      <p>15:4 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.</p>
      <p>15:5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.</p>
      <p>15:6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.</p>
      <p>15:7 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.</p>
      <p>15:8 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? </p>
      <p>15:9 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.</p>
      <p>15:10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.</p>
      <p>15:11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.</p>
      <p>15:12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.</p>
      <p>15:13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not their&rsquo;s, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;</p>
      <p>15:14 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.</p>
      <p>15:15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.</p>
      <p>15:16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.</p>
      <p>15:17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.</p>
      <p>15:18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:</p>
      <p>15:19 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,</p>
      <p>15:20 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,</p>

      <p>16:1 Now Sarai Abram&rsquo;s wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.</p>
      <p>16:2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.</p>
      <p>16:3 And Sarai Abram&rsquo;s wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.</p>
      <p>16:4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.</p>
      <p>16:5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.</p>
      <p>16:6 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.</p>
      <p>16:7 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.</p>
      <p>16:8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai&rsquo;s maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.</p>
      <p>16:9 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.</p>
      <p>16:10 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.</p>
      <p>16:11 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.</p>
      <p>16:12 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man&rsquo;s hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.</p>
      <p>16:13 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me? </p>
      <p>16:14 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.</p>
      <p>16:15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son&rsquo;s name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.</p>
      <p>16:16 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.</p>

      <p>17:1 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.</p>
      <p>17:2 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.</p>
      <p>17:3 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,</p>
      <p>17:4 As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.</p>
      <p>17:5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.</p>
      <p>17:6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.</p>
      <p>17:7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.</p>
      <p>17:8 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.</p>
      <p>17:9 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.</p>
      <p>17:10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.</p>
      <p>17:11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.</p>
      <p>17:12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.</p>
      <p>17:13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.</p>
      <p>17:14 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.</p>
      <p>17:15 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.</p>
      <p>17:16 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.</p>
      <p>17:17 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear? </p>
      <p>17:18 And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee! </p>
      <p>17:19 And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.</p>
      <p>17:20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.</p>
      <p>17:21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.</p>
      <p>17:22 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.</p>
      <p>17:23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham&rsquo;s house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.</p>
      <p>17:24 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.</p>
      <p>17:25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.</p>
      <p>17:26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.</p>
      <p>17:27 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.</p>

      <p>18:1 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;</p>
      <p>18:2 And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,</p>
      <p>18:3 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:</p>
      <p>18:4 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:</p>
      <p>18:5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.</p>
      <p>18:6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.</p>
      <p>18:7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.</p>
      <p>18:8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.</p>
      <p>18:9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.</p>
      <p>18:10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.</p>
      <p>18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</p>
      <p>18:12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? </p>
      <p>18:13 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? </p>
      <p>18:14 Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.</p>
      <p>18:15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.</p>
      <p>18:16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.</p>
      <p>18:17 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;</p>
      <p>18:18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?</p>
      <p>18:19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.</p>
      <p>18:20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;</p>
      <p>18:21 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.</p>
      <p>18:22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.</p>
      <p>18:23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? </p>
      <p>18:24 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein? </p>
      <p>18:25 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? </p>
      <p>18:26 And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.</p>
      <p>18:27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:</p>
      <p>18:28 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.</p>
      <p>18:29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty&rsquo;s sake.</p>
      <p>18:30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.</p>
      <p>18:31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty&rsquo;s sake.</p>
      <p>18:32 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten&rsquo;s sake.</p>
      <p>18:33 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</p>

      <p>19:1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;</p>
      <p>19:2 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant&rsquo;s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.</p>
      <p>19:3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.</p>
      <p>19:4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:</p>
      <p>19:5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.</p>
      <p>19:6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,</p>
      <p>19:7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.</p>
      <p>19:8 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.</p>
      <p>19:9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.</p>
      <p>19:10 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.</p>
      <p>19:11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.</p>
      <p>19:12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:</p>
      <p>19:13 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.</p>
      <p>19:14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.</p>
      <p>19:15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.</p>
      <p>19:16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.</p>
      <p>19:17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.</p>
      <p>19:18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:</p>
      <p>19:19 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:</p>
      <p>19:20 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.</p>
      <p>19:21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.</p>
      <p>19:22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.</p>
      <p>19:23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.</p>
      <p>19:24 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;</p>
      <p>19:25 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.</p>
      <p>19:26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.</p>
      <p>19:27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:</p>
      <p>19:28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.</p>
      <p>19:29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.</p>
      <p>19:30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.</p>
      <p>19:31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:</p>
      <p>19:32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.</p>
      <p>19:33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.</p>
      <p>19:34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.</p>
      <p>19:35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.</p>
      <p>19:36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.</p>
      <p>19:37 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.</p>
      <p>19:38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.</p>

      <p>20:1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.</p>
      <p>20:2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.</p>
      <p>20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man&rsquo;s wife.</p>
      <p>20:4 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation? </p>
      <p>20:5 Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.</p>
      <p>20:6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.</p>
      <p>20:7 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.</p>
      <p>20:8 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.</p>
      <p>20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.</p>
      <p>20:10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing? </p>
      <p>20:11 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife&rsquo;s sake.</p>
      <p>20:12 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.</p>
      <p>20:13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father&rsquo;s house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.</p>
      <p>20:14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.</p>
      <p>20:15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.</p>
      <p>20:16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.</p>
      <p>20:17 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.</p>
      <p>20:18 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham&rsquo;s wife.</p>

      <p>21:1 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.</p>
      <p>21:2 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.</p>
      <p>21:3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.</p>
      <p>21:4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.</p>
      <p>21:5 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.</p>
      <p>21:6 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.</p>
      <p>21:7 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.</p>
      <p>21:8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.</p>
      <p>21:9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.</p>
      <p>21:10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.</p>
      <p>21:11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham&rsquo;s sight because of his son.</p>
      <p>21:12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.</p>
      <p>21:13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.</p>
      <p>21:14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.</p>
      <p>21:15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.</p>
      <p>21:16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.</p>
      <p>21:17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.</p>
      <p>21:18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.</p>
      <p>21:19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.</p>
      <p>21:20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.</p>
      <p>21:21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>21:22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:</p>
      <p>21:23 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son&rsquo;s son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.</p>
      <p>21:24 And Abraham said, I will swear.</p>
      <p>21:25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech&rsquo;s servants had violently taken away.</p>
      <p>21:26 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.</p>
      <p>21:27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.</p>
      <p>21:28 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.</p>
      <p>21:29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves? </p>
      <p>21:30 And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.</p>
      <p>21:31 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them.</p>
      <p>21:32 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.</p>
      <p>21:33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.</p>
      <p>21:34 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines&rsquo; land many days.</p>

      <p>22:1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.</p>
      <p>22:2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.</p>
      <p>22:3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.</p>
      <p>22:4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.</p>
      <p>22:5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.</p>
      <p>22:6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.</p>
      <p>22:7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering? </p>
      <p>22:8 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.</p>
      <p>22:9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.</p>
      <p>22:10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.</p>
      <p>22:11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.</p>
      <p>22:12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.</p>
      <p>22:13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.</p>
      <p>22:14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.</p>
      <p>22:15 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,</p>
      <p>22:16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:</p>
      <p>22:17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;</p>
      <p>22:18 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.</p>
      <p>22:19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.</p>
      <p>22:20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;</p>
      <p>22:21 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,</p>
      <p>22:22 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.</p>
      <p>22:23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham&rsquo;s brother.</p>
      <p>22:24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.</p>

      <p>23:1 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah.</p>
      <p>23:2 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.</p>
      <p>23:3 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,</p>
      <p>23:4 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.</p>
      <p>23:5 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,</p>
      <p>23:6 Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.</p>
      <p>23:7 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.</p>
      <p>23:8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,</p>
      <p>23:9 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.</p>
      <p>23:10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,</p>
      <p>23:11 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.</p>
      <p>23:12 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.</p>
      <p>23:13 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.</p>
      <p>23:14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,</p>
      <p>23:15 My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.</p>
      <p>23:16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.</p>
      <p>23:17 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure</p>
      <p>23:18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.</p>

      <p>24:1 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.</p>
      <p>24:2 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:</p>
      <p>24:3 And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:</p>
      <p>24:4 But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.</p>
      <p>24:5 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest? </p>
      <p>24:6 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.</p>
      <p>24:7 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father&rsquo;s house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.</p>
      <p>24:8 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.</p>
      <p>24:9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.</p>
      <p>24:10 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.</p>
      <p>24:11 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.</p>
      <p>24:12 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.</p>
      <p>24:13 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:</p>
      <p>24:14 And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.</p>
      <p>24:15 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham&rsquo;s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.</p>
      <p>24:16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.</p>
      <p>24:17 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.</p>
      <p>24:18 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.</p>
      <p>24:19 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.</p>
      <p>24:20 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.</p>
      <p>24:21 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.</p>
      <p>24:22 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;</p>
      <p>24:23 And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father&rsquo;s house for us to lodge in? </p>
      <p>24:24 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.</p>
      <p>24:25 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.</p>
      <p>24:26 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.</p>
      <p>24:27 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master&rsquo;s brethren.</p>
      <p>24:28 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother&rsquo;s house these things.</p>
      <p>24:29 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.</p>
      <p>24:30 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister&rsquo;s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.</p>
      <p>24:31 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.</p>
      <p>24:32 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men&rsquo;s feet that were with him.</p>
      <p>24:33 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.</p>
      <p>24:34 And he said, I am Abraham&rsquo;s servant.</p>
      <p>24:35 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.</p>
      <p>24:36 And Sarah my master&rsquo;s wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.</p>
      <p>24:37 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:</p>
      <p>24:38 But thou shalt go unto my father&rsquo;s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.</p>
      <p>24:39 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.</p>
      <p>24:40 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father&rsquo;s house:</p>
      <p>24:41 Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.</p>
      <p>24:42 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:</p>
      <p>24:43 Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;</p>
      <p>24:44 And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master&rsquo;s son.</p>
      <p>24:45 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.</p>
      <p>24:46 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.</p>
      <p>24:47 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor&rsquo;s son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.</p>
      <p>24:48 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s daughter unto his son.</p>
      <p>24:49 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.</p>
      <p>24:50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.</p>
      <p>24:51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s wife, as the LORD hath spoken.</p>
      <p>24:52 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham&rsquo;s servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.</p>
      <p>24:53 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.</p>
      <p>24:54 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.</p>
      <p>24:55 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.</p>
      <p>24:56 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.</p>
      <p>24:57 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.</p>
      <p>24:58 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.</p>
      <p>24:59 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham&rsquo;s servant, and his men.</p>
      <p>24:60 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.</p>
      <p>24:61 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.</p>
      <p>24:62 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country.</p>
      <p>24:63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.</p>
      <p>24:64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.</p>
      <p>24:65 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.</p>
      <p>24:66 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.</p>
      <p>24:67 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah&rsquo;s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother&rsquo;s death.</p>

      <p>25:1 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.</p>
      <p>25:2 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.</p>
      <p>25:3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.</p>
      <p>25:4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.</p>
      <p>25:5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.</p>
      <p>25:6 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.</p>
      <p>25:7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham&rsquo;s life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.</p>
      <p>25:8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.</p>
      <p>25:9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;</p>
      <p>25:10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.</p>
      <p>25:11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.</p>
      <p>25:12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham&rsquo;s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah&rsquo;s handmaid, bare unto Abraham:</p>
      <p>25:13 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,</p>
      <p>25:14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,</p>
      <p>25:15 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:</p>
      <p>25:16 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.</p>
      <p>25:17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.</p>
      <p>25:18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.</p>
      <p>25:19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham&rsquo;s son: Abraham begat Isaac:</p>
      <p>25:20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.</p>
      <p>25:21 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</p>
      <p>25:22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.</p>
      <p>25:23 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.</p>
      <p>25:24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.</p>
      <p>25:25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.</p>
      <p>25:26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau&rsquo;s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.</p>
      <p>25:27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.</p>
      <p>25:28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.</p>
      <p>25:29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:</p>
      <p>25:30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.</p>
      <p>25:31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.</p>
      <p>25:32 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me? </p>
      <p>25:33 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.</p>
      <p>25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.</p>

      <p>26:1 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.</p>
      <p>26:2 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:</p>
      <p>26:3 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;</p>
      <p>26:4 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;</p>
      <p>26:5 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.</p>
      <p>26:6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:</p>
      <p>26:7 And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.</p>
      <p>26:8 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.</p>
      <p>26:9 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.</p>
      <p>26:10 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.</p>
      <p>26:11 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.</p>
      <p>26:12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.</p>
      <p>26:13 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:</p>
      <p>26:14 For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.</p>
      <p>26:15 For all the wells which his father&rsquo;s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.</p>
      <p>26:16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.</p>
      <p>26:17 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.</p>
      <p>26:18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.</p>
      <p>26:19 And Isaac&rsquo;s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.</p>
      <p>26:20 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac&rsquo;s herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.</p>
      <p>26:21 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.</p>
      <p>26:22 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.</p>
      <p>26:23 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.</p>
      <p>26:24 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham&rsquo;s sake.</p>
      <p>26:25 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac&rsquo;s servants digged a well.</p>
      <p>26:26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.</p>
      <p>26:27 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you? </p>
      <p>26:28 And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;</p>
      <p>26:29 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.</p>
      <p>26:30 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.</p>
      <p>26:31 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.</p>
      <p>26:32 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac&rsquo;s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.</p>
      <p>26:33 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day.</p>
      <p>26:34 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:</p>
      <p>26:35 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.</p>

      <p>27:1 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.</p>
      <p>27:2 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:</p>
      <p>27:3 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;</p>
      <p>27:4 And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.</p>
      <p>27:5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.</p>
      <p>27:6 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,</p>
      <p>27:7 Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death.</p>
      <p>27:8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.</p>
      <p>27:9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:</p>
      <p>27:10 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.</p>
      <p>27:11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:</p>
      <p>27:12 My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.</p>
      <p>27:13 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.</p>
      <p>27:14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.</p>
      <p>27:15 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:</p>
      <p>27:16 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:</p>
      <p>27:17 And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.</p>
      <p>27:18 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son? </p>
      <p>27:19 And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.</p>
      <p>27:20 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me.</p>
      <p>27:21 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.</p>
      <p>27:22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob&rsquo;s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.</p>
      <p>27:23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau&rsquo;s hands: so he blessed him.</p>
      <p>27:24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.</p>
      <p>27:25 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son&rsquo;s venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.</p>
      <p>27:26 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.</p>
      <p>27:27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:</p>
      <p>27:28 Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:</p>
      <p>27:29 Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother&rsquo;s sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.</p>
      <p>27:30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.</p>
      <p>27:31 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son&rsquo;s venison, that thy soul may bless me.</p>
      <p>27:32 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.</p>
      <p>27:33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.</p>
      <p>27:34 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.</p>
      <p>27:35 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.</p>
      <p>27:36 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me? </p>
      <p>27:37 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son? </p>
      <p>27:38 And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.</p>
      <p>27:39 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;</p>
      <p>27:40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.</p>
      <p>27:41 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.</p>
      <p>27:42 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.</p>
      <p>27:43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;</p>
      <p>27:44 And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother&rsquo;s fury turn away;</p>
      <p>27:45 Until thy brother&rsquo;s anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day? </p>
      <p>27:46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me? </p>

      <p>28:4 And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.</p>
      <p>28:5 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob&rsquo;s and Esau&rsquo;s mother.</p>
      <p>28:6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughers of Canaan;</p>
      <p>28:7 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram;</p>
      <p>28:8 And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;</p>
      <p>28:9 Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham&rsquo;s son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.</p>
      <p>28:10 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.</p>
      <p>28:11 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.</p>
      <p>28:12 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.</p>
      <p>28:13 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;</p>
      <p>28:14 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</p>
      <p>28:15 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.</p>
      <p>28:16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.</p>
      <p>28:17 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.</p>
      <p>28:18 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.</p>
      <p>28:19 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.</p>
      <p>28:20 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,</p>
      <p>28:21 So that I come again to my father&rsquo;s house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:</p>
      <p>28:22 And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God&rsquo;s house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.</p>

      <p>29:1 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.</p>
      <p>29:2 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
      <p>29:3 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well&rsquo;s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well&rsquo;s mouth in his place.</p>
      <p>29:4 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we.</p>
      <p>29:5 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.</p>
      <p>29:6 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.</p>
      <p>29:7 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.</p>
      <p>29:8 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well&rsquo;s mouth; then we water the sheep.</p>
      <p>29:9 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father&rsquo;s sheep; for she kept them.</p>
      <p>29:10 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother&rsquo;s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother&rsquo;s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well&rsquo;s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother&rsquo;s brother.</p>
      <p>29:11 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.</p>
      <p>29:12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father&rsquo;s brother, and that he was Rebekah&rsquo;s son: and she ran and told her father.</p>
      <p>29:13 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister&rsquo;s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.</p>
      <p>29:14 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.</p>
      <p>29:15 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be? </p>
      <p>29:16 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.</p>
      <p>29:17 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.</p>
      <p>29:18 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.</p>
      <p>29:19 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.</p>
      <p>29:20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.</p>
      <p>29:21 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.</p>
      <p>29:22 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.</p>
      <p>29:23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.</p>
      <p>29:24 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid.</p>
      <p>29:25 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?</p>
      <p>29:26 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.</p>
      <p>29:27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.</p>
      <p>29:28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.</p>
      <p>29:29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.</p>
      <p>29:30 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.</p>
      <p>29:31 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.</p>
      <p>29:32 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.</p>
      <p>29:33 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon.</p>
      <p>29:34 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.</p>
      <p>29:35 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.</p>

      <p>30:1 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.</p>
      <p>30:2 And Jacob&rsquo;s anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God&rsquo;s stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?</p>
      <p>30:3 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.</p>
      <p>30:4 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.</p>
      <p>30:5 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.</p>
      <p>30:6 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.</p>
      <p>30:7 And Bilhah Rachel&rsquo;s maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son.</p>
      <p>30:8 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.</p>
      <p>30:9 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.</p>
      <p>30:10 And Zilpah Leah&rsquo;s maid bare Jacob a son.</p>
      <p>30:11 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.</p>
      <p>30:12 And Zilpah Leah&rsquo;s maid bare Jacob a second son.</p>
      <p>30:13 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher.</p>
      <p>30:14 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son&rsquo;s mandrakes.</p>
      <p>30:15 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son&rsquo;s mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son&rsquo;s mandrakes.</p>
      <p>30:16 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son&rsquo;s mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.</p>
      <p>30:17 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son.</p>
      <p>30:18 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.</p>
      <p>30:19 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.</p>
      <p>30:20 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.</p>
      <p>30:21 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.</p>
      <p>30:22 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.</p>
      <p>30:23 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach:</p>
      <p>30:24 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son.</p>
      <p>30:25 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.</p>
      <p>30:26 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.</p>
      <p>30:27 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.</p>
      <p>30:28 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.</p>
      <p>30:29 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me.</p>
      <p>30:30 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also? </p>
      <p>30:31 And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock.</p>
      <p>30:32 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.</p>
      <p>30:33 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.</p>
      <p>30:34 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.</p>
      <p>30:35 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.</p>
      <p>30:36 And he set three days&rsquo; journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban&rsquo;s flocks.</p>
      <p>30:37 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.</p>
      <p>30:38 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.</p>
      <p>30:39 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.</p>
      <p>30:40 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban&rsquo;s cattle.</p>
      <p>30:41 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.</p>
      <p>30:42 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban&rsquo;s, and the stronger Jacob&rsquo;s.</p>
      <p>30:43 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.</p>

      <p>31:1 And he heard the words of Laban&rsquo;s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father&rsquo;s; and of that which was our father&rsquo;s hath he gotten all this glory.</p>
      <p>31:2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.</p>
      <p>31:3 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.</p>
      <p>31:4 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,</p>
      <p>31:5 And said unto them, I see your father&rsquo;s countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.</p>
      <p>31:6 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.</p>
      <p>31:7 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.</p>
      <p>31:8 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.</p>
      <p>31:9 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.</p>
      <p>31:10 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.</p>
      <p>31:11 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.</p>
      <p>31:12 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.</p>
      <p>31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.</p>
      <p>31:14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father&rsquo;s house? </p>
      <p>31:15 Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.</p>
      <p>31:16 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children&rsquo;s: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.</p>
      <p>31:17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;</p>
      <p>31:18 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.</p>
      <p>31:19 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father&rsquo;s.</p>
      <p>31:20 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.</p>
      <p>31:21 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.</p>
      <p>31:22 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.</p>
      <p>31:23 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days&rsquo; journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.</p>
      <p>31:24 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.</p>
      <p>31:25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.</p>
      <p>31:26 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword? </p>
      <p>31:27 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?</p>
      <p>31:28 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.</p>
      <p>31:29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.</p>
      <p>31:30 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father&rsquo;s house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods? </p>
      <p>31:31 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.</p>
      <p>31:32 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.</p>
      <p>31:33 And Laban went into Jacob&rsquo;s tent, and into Leah&rsquo;s tent, and into the two maidservants&rsquo; tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah&rsquo;s tent, and entered into Rachel&rsquo;s tent.</p>
      <p>31:34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel&rsquo;s furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.</p>
      <p>31:35 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched but found not the images.</p>
      <p>31:36 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me? </p>
      <p>31:37 Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.</p>
      <p>31:38 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.</p>
      <p>31:39 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.</p>
      <p>31:40 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.</p>
      <p>31:41 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.</p>
      <p>31:42 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.</p>
      <p>31:43 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?</p>
      <p>31:44 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.</p>
      <p>31:45 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.</p>
      <p>31:46 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.</p>
      <p>31:47 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.</p>
      <p>31:48 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;</p>
      <p>31:49 And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.</p>
      <p>31:50 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.</p>
      <p>31:51 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:</p>
      <p>31:52 This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.</p>
      <p>31:53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.</p>
      <p>31:54 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.</p>
      <p>31:55 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.</p>

      <p>32:1 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</p>
      <p>32:2 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God&rsquo;s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.</p>
      <p>32:3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.</p>
      <p>32:4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:</p>
      <p>32:5 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.</p>
      <p>32:6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.</p>
      <p>32:7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;</p>
      <p>32:8 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.</p>
      <p>32:9 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:</p>
      <p>32:10 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.</p>
      <p>32:11 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.</p>
      <p>32:12 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.</p>
      <p>32:13 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;</p>
      <p>32:14 Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,</p>
      <p>32:15 Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.</p>
      <p>32:16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.</p>
      <p>32:17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? </p>
      <p>32:18 Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob&rsquo;s; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.</p>
      <p>32:19 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.</p>
      <p>32:20 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.</p>
      <p>32:21 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.</p>
      <p>32:22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.</p>
      <p>32:23 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.</p>
      <p>32:24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.</p>
      <p>32:25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob&rsquo;s thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.</p>
      <p>32:26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.</p>
      <p>32:27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.</p>
      <p>32:28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.</p>
      <p>32:29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.</p>
      <p>32:30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.</p>
      <p>32:31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.</p>
      <p>32:32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob&rsquo;s thigh in the sinew that shrank.</p>

      <p>33:1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.</p>
      <p>33:2 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.</p>
      <p>33:3 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.</p>
      <p>33:4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.</p>
      <p>33:5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.</p>
      <p>33:6 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.</p>
      <p>33:7 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.</p>
      <p>33:8 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.</p>
      <p>33:9 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.</p>
      <p>33:10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.</p>
      <p>33:11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.</p>
      <p>33:12 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.</p>
      <p>33:13 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.</p>
      <p>33:14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.</p>
      <p>33:15 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.</p>
      <p>33:16 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.</p>
      <p>33:17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.</p>
      <p>33:18 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city.</p>
      <p>33:19 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem&rsquo;s father, for an hundred pieces of money.</p>
      <p>33:20 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.</p>

      <p>34:1 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.</p>
      <p>34:2 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.</p>
      <p>34:3 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.</p>
      <p>34:4 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.</p>
      <p>34:5 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.</p>
      <p>34:6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.</p>
      <p>34:7 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob&rsquo;s daughter: which thing ought not to be done.</p>
      <p>34:8 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.</p>
      <p>34:9 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.</p>
      <p>34:10 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.</p>
      <p>34:11 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.</p>
      <p>34:12 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.</p>
      <p>34:13 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:</p>
      <p>34:14 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:</p>
      <p>34:15 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;</p>
      <p>34:16 Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.</p>
      <p>34:17 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.</p>
      <p>34:18 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor&rsquo;s son.</p>
      <p>34:19 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob&rsquo;s daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father.</p>
      <p>34:20 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,</p>
      <p>34:21 These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.</p>
      <p>34:22 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.</p>
      <p>34:23 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of their&rsquo;s be our&rsquo;s? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.</p>
      <p>34:24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.</p>
      <p>34:25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah&rsquo;s brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.</p>
      <p>34:26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem&rsquo;s house, and went out.</p>
      <p>34:27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.</p>
      <p>34:28 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,</p>
      <p>34:29 And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.</p>
      <p>34:30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.</p>
      <p>34:31 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?</p>

      <p>35:1 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.</p>
      <p>35:2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:</p>
      <p>35:3 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.</p>
      <p>35:4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.</p>
      <p>35:5 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.</p>
      <p>35:6 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.</p>
      <p>35:7 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.</p>
      <p>35:8 But Deborah Rebekah&rsquo;s nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.</p>
      <p>35:9 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him.</p>
      <p>35:10 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.</p>
      <p>35:11 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;</p>
      <p>35:12 And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.</p>
      <p>35:13 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.</p>
      <p>35:14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.</p>
      <p>35:15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.</p>
      <p>35:16 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.</p>
      <p>35:17 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.</p>
      <p>35:18 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.</p>
      <p>35:19 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.</p>
      <p>35:20 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel&rsquo;s grave unto this day.</p>
      <p>35:21 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.</p>
      <p>35:22 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father&rsquo;s concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:</p>
      <p>35:23 The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob&rsquo;s firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:</p>
      <p>35:24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:</p>
      <p>35:25 And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel&rsquo;s handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:</p>
      <p>35:26 And the sons of Zilpah, Leah&rsquo;s handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.</p>
      <p>35:27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.</p>
      <p>35:28 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.</p>
      <p>35:29 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.</p>

      <p>36:7 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.</p>

      <p>36:25 And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.</p>

      <p>36:39 And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife&rsquo;s name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.</p>
      <p>36:40 And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,</p>
      <p>36:41 Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,</p>
      <p>36:42 Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,</p>
      <p>36:43 Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites.</p>

      <p>37:1 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.</p>
      <p>37:2 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father&rsquo;s wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.</p>
      <p>37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.</p>
      <p>37:4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.</p>
      <p>37:5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.</p>
      <p>37:6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:</p>
      <p>37:7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.</p>
      <p>37:8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.</p>
      <p>37:9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.</p>
      <p>37:10 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed?  Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth? </p>
      <p>37:11 And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.</p>
      <p>37:12 And his brethren went to feed their father&rsquo;s flock in Shechem.</p>
      <p>37:13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.</p>
      <p>37:14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.</p>
      <p>37:15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou? </p>
      <p>37:16 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.</p>
      <p>37:17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.</p>
      <p>37:18 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.</p>
      <p>37:19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.</p>
      <p>37:20 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.</p>
      <p>37:21 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.</p>
      <p>37:22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.</p>
      <p>37:23 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him;</p>
      <p>37:24 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.</p>
      <p>37:25 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.</p>
      <p>37:26 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood? </p>
      <p>37:27 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.</p>
      <p>37:28 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.</p>
      <p>37:29 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.</p>
      <p>37:30 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go? </p>
      <p>37:31 And they took Joseph&rsquo;s coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;</p>
      <p>37:32 And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son&rsquo;s coat or no.</p>
      <p>37:33 And he knew it, and said, It is my son&rsquo;s coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.</p>
      <p>37:34 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.</p>
      <p>37:35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.</p>
      <p>37:36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh&rsquo;s, and captain of the guard.</p>

      <p>38:1 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.</p>
      <p>38:2 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.</p>
      <p>38:3 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.</p>
      <p>38:4 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.</p>
      <p>38:5 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.</p>
      <p>38:6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.</p>
      <p>38:7 And Er, Judah&rsquo;s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.</p>
      <p>38:8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother&rsquo;s wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.</p>
      <p>38:9 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother&rsquo;s wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.</p>
      <p>38:10 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.</p>
      <p>38:11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father&rsquo;s house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father&rsquo;s house.</p>
      <p>38:12 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah&rsquo;s wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.</p>
      <p>38:13 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.</p>
      <p>38:14 And she put her widow&rsquo;s garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.</p>
      <p>38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face.</p>
      <p>38:16 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me? </p>
      <p>38:17 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it? </p>
      <p>38:18 And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.</p>
      <p>38:19 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.</p>
      <p>38:20 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman&rsquo;s hand: but he found her not.</p>
      <p>38:21 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place.</p>
      <p>38:22 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.</p>
      <p>38:23 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.</p>
      <p>38:24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.</p>
      <p>38:25 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.</p>
      <p>38:26 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.</p>
      <p>38:27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.</p>
      <p>38:28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.</p>
      <p>38:29 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.</p>
      <p>38:30 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.</p>

      <p>39:1 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.</p>
      <p>39:2 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.</p>
      <p>39:3 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.</p>
      <p>39:4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.</p>
      <p>39:5 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian&rsquo;s house for Joseph&rsquo;s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.</p>
      <p>39:6 And he left all that he had in Joseph&rsquo;s hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured.</p>
      <p>39:7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master&rsquo;s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.</p>
      <p>39:8 But he refused, and said unto his master&rsquo;s wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;</p>
      <p>39:9 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God? </p>
      <p>39:10 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.</p>
      <p>39:11 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.</p>
      <p>39:12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.</p>
      <p>39:13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,</p>
      <p>39:14 That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:</p>
      <p>39:15 And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.</p>
      <p>39:16 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.</p>
      <p>39:17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:</p>
      <p>39:18 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.</p>
      <p>39:19 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.</p>
      <p>39:20 And Joseph&rsquo;s master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king&rsquo;s prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.</p>
      <p>39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.</p>
      <p>39:22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph&rsquo;s hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.</p>
      <p>39:23 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper.</p>

      <p>40:1 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.</p>
      <p>40:2 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.</p>
      <p>40:3 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.</p>
      <p>40:4 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward.</p>
      <p>40:5 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.</p>
      <p>40:6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad.</p>
      <p>40:7 And he asked Pharaoh&rsquo;s officers that were with him in the ward of his lord&rsquo;s house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day? </p>
      <p>40:8 And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.</p>
      <p>40:9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;</p>
      <p>40:10 And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:</p>
      <p>40:11 And Pharaoh&rsquo;s cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh&rsquo;s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh&rsquo;s hand.</p>
      <p>40:12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:</p>
      <p>40:13 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh&rsquo;s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.</p>
      <p>40:14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:</p>
      <p>40:15 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.</p>
      <p>40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:</p>
      <p>40:17 And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.</p>
      <p>40:18 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:</p>
      <p>40:19 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.</p>
      <p>40:20 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh&rsquo;s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.</p>
      <p>40:21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh&rsquo;s hand:</p>
      <p>40:22 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.</p>
      <p>40:23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.</p>

      <p>41:1 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.</p>
      <p>41:2 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.</p>
      <p>41:3 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.</p>
      <p>41:4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.</p>
      <p>41:5 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.</p>
      <p>41:6 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.</p>
      <p>41:7 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.</p>
      <p>41:8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.</p>
      <p>41:9 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:</p>
      <p>41:10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard&rsquo;s house, both me and the chief baker:</p>
      <p>41:11 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.</p>
      <p>41:12 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.</p>
      <p>41:13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.</p>
      <p>41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.</p>
      <p>41:15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.</p>
      <p>41:16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.</p>
      <p>41:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:</p>
      <p>41:18 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:</p>
      <p>41:19 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:</p>
      <p>41:20 And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:</p>
      <p>41:21 And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.</p>
      <p>41:22 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:</p>
      <p>41:23 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:</p>
      <p>41:24 And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.</p>
      <p>41:25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.</p>
      <p>41:26 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.</p>
      <p>41:27 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.</p>
      <p>41:28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.</p>
      <p>41:29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:</p>
      <p>41:30 And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;</p>
      <p>41:31 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.</p>
      <p>41:32 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.</p>
      <p>41:33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>41:34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.</p>
      <p>41:35 And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.</p>
      <p>41:36 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.</p>
      <p>41:37 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.</p>
      <p>41:38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is? </p>
      <p>41:39 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:</p>
      <p>41:40 Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.</p>
      <p>41:41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>41:42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph&rsquo;s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;</p>
      <p>41:43 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>41:44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>41:45 And Pharaoh called Joseph&rsquo;s name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>41:46 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>41:47 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.</p>
      <p>41:48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.</p>
      <p>41:49 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number.</p>
      <p>41:50 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.</p>
      <p>41:51 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father&rsquo;s house.</p>
      <p>41:52 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.</p>
      <p>41:53 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.</p>
      <p>41:54 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.</p>
      <p>41:55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.</p>
      <p>41:56 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>41:57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.</p>

      <p>42:1 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another? </p>
      <p>42:2 And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.</p>
      <p>42:3 And Joseph&rsquo;s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.</p>
      <p>42:4 But Benjamin, Joseph&rsquo;s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.</p>
      <p>42:5 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.</p>
      <p>42:6 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph&rsquo;s brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.</p>
      <p>42:7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.</p>
      <p>42:8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.</p>
      <p>42:9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.</p>
      <p>42:10 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.</p>
      <p>42:11 We are all one man&rsquo;s sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.</p>
      <p>42:12 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.</p>
      <p>42:13 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.</p>
      <p>42:14 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:</p>
      <p>42:15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.</p>
      <p>42:16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.</p>
      <p>42:17 And he put them all together into ward three days.</p>
      <p>42:18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:</p>
      <p>42:19 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:</p>
      <p>42:20 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.</p>
      <p>42:21 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.</p>
      <p>42:22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.</p>
      <p>42:23 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter.</p>
      <p>42:24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.</p>
      <p>42:25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man&rsquo;s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.</p>
      <p>42:26 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.</p>
      <p>42:27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
      <p>42:28 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us? </p>
      <p>42:29 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,</p>
      <p>42:30 The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.</p>
      <p>42:31 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:</p>
      <p>42:32 We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.</p>
      <p>42:33 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:</p>
      <p>42:34 And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.</p>
      <p>42:35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man&rsquo;s bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.</p>
      <p>42:36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.</p>
      <p>42:37 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.</p>
      <p>42:38 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</p>

      <p>43:1 And the famine was sore in the land.</p>
      <p>43:2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.</p>
      <p>43:3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.</p>
      <p>43:4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:</p>
      <p>43:5 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.</p>
      <p>43:6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother? </p>
      <p>43:7 And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down? </p>
      <p>43:8 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.</p>
      <p>43:9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:</p>
      <p>43:10 For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.</p>
      <p>43:11 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:</p>
      <p>43:12 And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:</p>
      <p>43:13 Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:</p>
      <p>43:14 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.</p>
      <p>43:15 And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.</p>
      <p>43:16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.</p>
      <p>43:17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph&rsquo;s house.</p>
      <p>43:18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph&rsquo;s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.</p>
      <p>43:19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph&rsquo;s house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,</p>
      <p>43:20 And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:</p>
      <p>43:21 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man&rsquo;s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.</p>
      <p>43:22 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.</p>
      <p>43:23 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.</p>
      <p>43:24 And the man brought the men into Joseph&rsquo;s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.</p>
      <p>43:25 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.</p>
      <p>43:26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.</p>
      <p>43:27 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive? </p>
      <p>43:28 And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.</p>
      <p>43:29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother&rsquo;s son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.</p>
      <p>43:30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.</p>
      <p>43:31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.</p>
      <p>43:32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.</p>
      <p>43:33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.</p>
      <p>43:34 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin&rsquo;s mess was five times so much as any of their&rsquo;s. And they drank, and were merry with him.</p>

      <p>44:1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men&rsquo;s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man&rsquo;s money in his sack&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
      <p>44:2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack&rsquo;s mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.</p>
      <p>44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.</p>
      <p>44:4 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? </p>
      <p>44:5 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.</p>
      <p>44:6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.</p>
      <p>44:7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:</p>
      <p>44:8 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks&rsquo; mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord&rsquo;s house silver or gold? </p>
      <p>44:9 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord&rsquo;s bondmen.</p>
      <p>44:10 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.</p>
      <p>44:11 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.</p>
      <p>44:12 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin&rsquo;s sack.</p>
      <p>44:13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.</p>
      <p>44:14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph&rsquo;s house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.</p>
      <p>44:15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine? </p>
      <p>44:16 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak?  or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord&rsquo;s servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.</p>
      <p>44:17 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.</p>
      <p>44:18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord&rsquo;s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.</p>
      <p>44:19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? </p>
      <p>44:20 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.</p>
      <p>44:21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.</p>
      <p>44:22 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.</p>
      <p>44:23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.</p>
      <p>44:24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.</p>
      <p>44:25 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.</p>
      <p>44:26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man&rsquo;s face, except our youngest brother be with us.</p>
      <p>44:27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:</p>
      <p>44:28 And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:</p>
      <p>44:29 And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</p>
      <p>44:30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad&rsquo;s life;</p>
      <p>44:31 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.</p>
      <p>44:32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.</p>
      <p>44:33 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.</p>
      <p>44:34 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.</p>

      <p>45:1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.</p>
      <p>45:2 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.</p>
      <p>45:3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.</p>
      <p>45:4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.</p>
      <p>45:5 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.</p>
      <p>45:6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest.</p>
      <p>45:7 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.</p>
      <p>45:8 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>45:9 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:</p>
      <p>45:10 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children&rsquo;s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:</p>
      <p>45:11 And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.</p>
      <p>45:12 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.</p>
      <p>45:13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.</p>
      <p>45:14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin&rsquo;s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.</p>
      <p>45:15 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.</p>
      <p>45:16 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh&rsquo;s house, saying, Joseph&rsquo;s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.</p>
      <p>45:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;</p>
      <p>45:18 And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.</p>
      <p>45:19 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.</p>
      <p>45:20 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is your&rsquo;s.</p>
      <p>45:21 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.</p>
      <p>45:22 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.</p>
      <p>45:23 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.</p>
      <p>45:24 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.</p>
      <p>45:25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,</p>
      <p>45:26 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob&rsquo;s heart fainted, for he believed them not.</p>
      <p>45:27 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:</p>
      <p>45:28 And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.</p>

      <p>46:1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.</p>
      <p>46:2 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.</p>
      <p>46:3 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:</p>
      <p>46:4 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.</p>
      <p>46:5 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.</p>
      <p>46:6 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:</p>
      <p>46:7 His sons, and his sons&rsquo; sons with him, his daughters, and his sons&rsquo; daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.</p>
      <p>46:8 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob&rsquo;s firstborn.</p>
      <p>46:9 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.</p>
      <p>46:10 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.</p>
      <p>46:11 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</p>
      <p>46:12 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.</p>
      <p>46:13 And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.</p>
      <p>46:14 And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.</p>
      <p>46:15 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.</p>
      <p>46:16 And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.</p>
      <p>46:17 And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.</p>
      <p>46:18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.</p>
      <p>46:19 The sons of Rachel Jacob&rsquo;s wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.</p>
      <p>46:20 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.</p>
      <p>46:21 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.</p>
      <p>46:22 These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.</p>
      <p>46:23 And the sons of Dan; Hushim.</p>
      <p>46:24 And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.</p>
      <p>46:25 These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.</p>
      <p>46:26 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob&rsquo;s sons&rsquo; wives, all the souls were threescore and six;</p>
      <p>46:27 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.</p>
      <p>46:28 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.</p>
      <p>46:29 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.</p>
      <p>46:30 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive.</p>
      <p>46:31 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father&rsquo;s house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father&rsquo;s house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;</p>
      <p>46:32 And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.</p>
      <p>46:33 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation? </p>
      <p>46:34 That ye shall say, Thy servants&rsquo; trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.</p>

      <p>47:1 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.</p>
      <p>47:2 And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.</p>
      <p>47:3 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers.</p>
      <p>47:4 They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.</p>
      <p>47:5 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:</p>
      <p>47:6 The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.</p>
      <p>47:7 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.</p>
      <p>47:8 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou? </p>
      <p>47:9 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.</p>
      <p>47:10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.</p>
      <p>47:11 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.</p>
      <p>47:12 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father&rsquo;s household, with bread, according to their families.</p>
      <p>47:13 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.</p>
      <p>47:14 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh&rsquo;s house.</p>
      <p>47:15 And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.</p>
      <p>47:16 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.</p>
      <p>47:17 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.</p>
      <p>47:18 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:</p>
      <p>47:19 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.</p>
      <p>47:20 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh&rsquo;s.</p>
      <p>47:21 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.</p>
      <p>47:22 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.</p>
      <p>47:23 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.</p>
      <p>47:24 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.</p>
      <p>47:25 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh&rsquo;s servants.</p>
      <p>47:26 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh&rsquo;s.</p>
      <p>47:27 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.</p>
      <p>47:28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.</p>
      <p>47:29 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:</p>
      <p>47:30 But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.</p>
      <p>47:31 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed&rsquo;s head.</p>

      <p>48:1 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.</p>
      <p>48:2 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.</p>
      <p>48:3 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,</p>
      <p>48:4 And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.</p>
      <p>48:5 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.</p>
      <p>48:6 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.</p>
      <p>48:7 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.</p>
      <p>48:8 And Israel beheld Joseph&rsquo;s sons, and said, Who are these? </p>
      <p>48:9 And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.</p>
      <p>48:10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.</p>
      <p>48:11 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.</p>
      <p>48:12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.</p>
      <p>48:13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel&rsquo;s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel&rsquo;s right hand, and brought them near unto him.</p>
      <p>48:14 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim&rsquo;s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh&rsquo;s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.</p>
      <p>48:15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,</p>
      <p>48:16 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.</p>
      <p>48:17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father&rsquo;s hand, to remove it from Ephraim&rsquo;s head unto Manasseh&rsquo;s head.</p>
      <p>48:18 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.</p>
      <p>48:19 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.</p>
      <p>48:20 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</p>
      <p>48:21 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.</p>
      <p>48:22 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.</p>

      <p>49:1 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.</p>
      <p>49:2 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.</p>
      <p>49:3 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:</p>
      <p>49:4 Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father&rsquo;s bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.</p>
      <p>49:5 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.</p>
      <p>49:6 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.</p>
      <p>49:7 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.</p>
      <p>49:8 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father&rsquo;s children shall bow down before thee.</p>
      <p>49:9 Judah is a lion&rsquo;s whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up? </p>
      <p>49:10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.</p>
      <p>49:11 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass&rsquo;s colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:</p>
      <p>49:12 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.</p>
      <p>49:13 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.</p>
      <p>49:14 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:</p>
      <p>49:15 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.</p>
      <p>49:16 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.</p>
      <p>49:17 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.</p>
      <p>49:18 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.</p>
      <p>49:19 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.</p>
      <p>49:20 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.</p>
      <p>49:21 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.</p>
      <p>49:22 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:</p>
      <p>49:23 The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:</p>
      <p>49:24 But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)</p>
      <p>49:25 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:</p>
      <p>49:26 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.</p>
      <p>49:27 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.</p>
      <p>49:28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.</p>
      <p>49:29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,</p>
      <p>49:30 In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.</p>
      <p>49:31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.</p>
      <p>49:32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.</p>
      <p>49:33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.</p>

      <p>50:3 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.</p>

      <p>50:8 And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father&rsquo;s house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.</p>
      <p>50:9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.</p>
      <p>50:10 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.</p>
      <p>50:11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.</p>
      <p>50:12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:</p>
      <p>50:13 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.</p>
      <p>50:14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.</p>
      <p>50:15 And when Joseph&rsquo;s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.</p>
      <p>50:16 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,</p>
      <p>50:17 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.</p>
      <p>50:18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.</p>
      <p>50:19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God? </p>
      <p>50:20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.</p>
      <p>50:21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.</p>
      <p>50:22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father&rsquo;s house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.</p>
      <p>50:23 And Joseph saw Ephraim&rsquo;s children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph&rsquo;s knees.</p>
      <p>50:24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</p>
      <p>50:25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.</p>
      <p>50:26 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</p>

      <p>1:1 Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.</p>
      <p>1:2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,</p>
      <p>1:3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,</p>
      <p>1:4 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.</p>
      <p>1:5 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.</p>
      <p>1:6 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.</p>
      <p>1:7 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.</p>
      <p>1:8 Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.</p>
      <p>1:9 And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:</p>
      <p>1:10 Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.</p>
      <p>1:11 Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.</p>
      <p>1:12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.</p>
      <p>1:13 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:</p>
      <p>1:14 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.</p>
      <p>1:15 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:</p>
      <p>1:16 And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.</p>
      <p>1:17 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.</p>
      <p>1:18 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive? </p>
      <p>1:19 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.</p>
      <p>1:20 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.</p>
      <p>1:21 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.</p>
      <p>1:22 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.</p>

      <p>2:1 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.</p>
      <p>2:2 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.</p>
      <p>2:3 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river&rsquo;s brink.</p>
      <p>2:4 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.</p>
      <p>2:5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river&rsquo;s side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.</p>
      <p>2:6 And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews&rsquo; children.</p>
      <p>2:7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? </p>
      <p>2:8 And Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child&rsquo;s mother.</p>
      <p>2:9 And Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took the child, and nursed it.</p>
      <p>2:10 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.</p>
      <p>2:11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.</p>
      <p>2:12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</p>
      <p>2:13 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? </p>
      <p>2:14 And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.</p>
      <p>2:15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.</p>
      <p>2:16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father&rsquo;s flock.</p>
      <p>2:17 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</p>
      <p>2:18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day? </p>
      <p>2:19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.</p>
      <p>2:20 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.</p>
      <p>2:21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.</p>
      <p>2:22 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.</p>
      <p>2:23 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.</p>
      <p>2:24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</p>
      <p>2:25 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them.</p>

      <p>3:1 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.</p>
      <p>3:2 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.</p>
      <p>3:3 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.</p>
      <p>3:4 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.</p>
      <p>3:5 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.</p>
      <p>3:6 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.</p>
      <p>3:7 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;</p>
      <p>3:8 And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.</p>
      <p>3:9 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.</p>
      <p>3:10 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.</p>
      <p>3:11 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?</p>
      <p>3:12 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.</p>
      <p>3:13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? </p>
      <p>3:14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.</p>
      <p>3:15 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.</p>
      <p>3:16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:</p>
      <p>3:17 And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.</p>
      <p>3:18 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days&rsquo; journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.</p>
      <p>3:19 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.</p>
      <p>3:20 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.</p>
      <p>3:21 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.</p>
      <p>3:22 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.</p>

      <p>4:1 And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee.</p>
      <p>4:2 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod.</p>
      <p>4:3 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.</p>
      <p>4:4 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:</p>
      <p>4:5 That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.</p>
      <p>4:6 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.</p>
      <p>4:7 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.</p>
      <p>4:8 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.</p>
      <p>4:9 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.</p>
      <p>4:10 And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.</p>
      <p>4:11 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man&rsquo;s mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD? </p>
      <p>4:12 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.</p>
      <p>4:13 And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.</p>
      <p>4:14 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.</p>
      <p>4:15 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.</p>
      <p>4:16 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.</p>
      <p>4:17 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.</p>
      <p>4:18 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.</p>
      <p>4:19 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life.</p>
      <p>4:20 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.</p>
      <p>4:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.</p>
      <p>4:22 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:</p>
      <p>4:23 And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.</p>
      <p>4:24 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him.</p>
      <p>4:25 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me.</p>
      <p>4:26 So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision.</p>
      <p>4:27 And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.</p>
      <p>4:28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.</p>
      <p>4:29 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:</p>
      <p>4:30 And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.</p>
      <p>4:31 And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.</p>

      <p>5:1 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.</p>
      <p>5:2 And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.</p>
      <p>5:3 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days&rsquo; journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.</p>
      <p>5:4 And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.</p>
      <p>5:5 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.</p>
      <p>5:6 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,</p>
      <p>5:7 Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.</p>
      <p>5:8 And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.</p>
      <p>5:9 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.</p>
      <p>5:10 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.</p>
      <p>5:11 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.</p>
      <p>5:12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.</p>
      <p>5:13 And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.</p>
      <p>5:14 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh&rsquo;s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore? </p>
      <p>5:15 Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants? </p>
      <p>5:16 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people.</p>
      <p>5:17 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD.</p>
      <p>5:18 Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.</p>
      <p>5:19 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task.</p>
      <p>5:20 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:</p>
      <p>5:21 And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.</p>
      <p>5:22 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?</p>
      <p>5:23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.</p>

      <p>6:1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.</p>
      <p>6:2 And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD:</p>
      <p>6:3 And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.</p>
      <p>6:4 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.</p>
      <p>6:5 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.</p>
      <p>6:6 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:</p>
      <p>6:7 And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.</p>
      <p>6:8 And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.</p>
      <p>6:9 And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.</p>
      <p>6:10 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>6:11 Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.</p>
      <p>6:12 And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips? </p>
      <p>6:13 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>6:14 These be the heads of their fathers&rsquo; houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these be the families of Reuben.</p>
      <p>6:15 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the families of Simeon.</p>
      <p>6:16 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.</p>
      <p>6:17 The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.</p>
      <p>6:18 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years.</p>
      <p>6:19 And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families of Levi according to their generations.</p>
      <p>6:20 And Amram took him Jochebed his father&rsquo;s sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years.</p>
      <p>6:21 And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.</p>
      <p>6:22 And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.</p>
      <p>6:23 And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.</p>
      <p>6:24 And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are the families of the Korhites.</p>
      <p>6:25 And Eleazar Aaron&rsquo;s son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.</p>
      <p>6:26 These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.</p>
      <p>6:27 These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.</p>
      <p>6:28 And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt,</p>
      <p>6:29 That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee.</p>
      <p>6:30 And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me? </p>

      <p>7:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.</p>
      <p>7:2 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land.</p>
      <p>7:3 And I will harden Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>7:4 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.</p>
      <p>7:5 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.</p>
      <p>7:6 And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.</p>
      <p>7:7 And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.</p>
      <p>7:8 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</p>
      <p>7:9 When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.</p>
      <p>7:10 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.</p>
      <p>7:11 Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.</p>
      <p>7:12 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron&rsquo;s rod swallowed up their rods.</p>
      <p>7:13 And he hardened Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.</p>
      <p>7:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go.</p>
      <p>7:15 Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river&rsquo;s brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.</p>
      <p>7:16 And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.</p>
      <p>7:17 Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.</p>
      <p>7:18 And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river.</p>
      <p>7:19 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.</p>
      <p>7:20 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.</p>
      <p>7:21 And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>7:22 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said.</p>
      <p>7:23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.</p>
      <p>7:24 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.</p>
      <p>7:25 And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river.</p>

      <p>8:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</p>
      <p>8:2 And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:</p>
      <p>8:3 And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:</p>
      <p>8:4 And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.</p>
      <p>8:5 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>8:6 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>8:7 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>8:8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>8:9 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only? </p>
      <p>8:10 And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our God.</p>
      <p>8:11 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.</p>
      <p>8:12 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.</p>
      <p>8:13 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.</p>
      <p>8:14 And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.</p>
      <p>8:15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.</p>
      <p>8:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>8:17 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>8:18 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.</p>
      <p>8:19 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.</p>
      <p>8:20 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</p>
      <p>8:21 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.</p>
      <p>8:22 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.</p>
      <p>8:23 And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be.</p>
      <p>8:24 And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants&rsquo; houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.</p>
      <p>8:25 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.</p>
      <p>8:26 And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us? </p>
      <p>8:27 We will go three days&rsquo; journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.</p>
      <p>8:28 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: intreat for me.</p>
      <p>8:29 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.</p>
      <p>8:30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.</p>
      <p>8:31 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.</p>
      <p>8:32 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.</p>

      <p>9:1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</p>
      <p>9:2 For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,</p>
      <p>9:3 Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.</p>
      <p>9:4 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children&rsquo;s of Israel.</p>
      <p>9:5 And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land.</p>
      <p>9:6 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.</p>
      <p>9:7 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.</p>
      <p>9:8 And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.</p>
      <p>9:9 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>9:10 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.</p>
      <p>9:11 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.</p>
      <p>9:12 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.</p>
      <p>9:13 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</p>
      <p>9:14 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.</p>
      <p>9:15 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.</p>
      <p>9:16 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.</p>
      <p>9:17 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go? </p>
      <p>9:18 Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.</p>
      <p>9:19 Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.</p>
      <p>9:20 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:</p>
      <p>9:21 And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field.</p>
      <p>9:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>9:23 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>9:24 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.</p>
      <p>9:25 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.</p>
      <p>9:26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.</p>
      <p>9:27 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.</p>
      <p>9:28 Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.</p>
      <p>9:29 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORD&rsquo;s.</p>
      <p>9:30 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God.</p>
      <p>9:31 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled.</p>
      <p>9:32 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown up.</p>
      <p>9:33 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.</p>
      <p>9:34 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.</p>
      <p>9:35 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.</p>

      <p>10:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him:</p>
      <p>10:2 And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son&rsquo;s son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the LORD.</p>
      <p>10:3 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.</p>
      <p>10:4 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast:</p>
      <p>10:5 And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:</p>
      <p>10:6 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers&rsquo; fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.</p>
      <p>10:7 And Pharaoh&rsquo;s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed? </p>
      <p>10:8 And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go? </p>
      <p>10:9 And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>10:10 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.</p>
      <p>10:11 Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh&rsquo;s presence.</p>
      <p>10:12 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.</p>
      <p>10:13 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.</p>
      <p>10:14 And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.</p>
      <p>10:15 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>10:16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.</p>
      <p>10:17 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.</p>
      <p>10:18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.</p>
      <p>10:19 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.</p>
      <p>10:20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.</p>
      <p>10:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.</p>
      <p>10:22 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:</p>
      <p>10:23 They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.</p>
      <p>10:24 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.</p>
      <p>10:25 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.</p>
      <p>10:26 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.</p>
      <p>10:27 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart, and he would not let them go.</p>
      <p>10:28 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.</p>
      <p>10:29 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.</p>

      <p>11:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.</p>
      <p>11:2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver and jewels of gold.</p>
      <p>11:3 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh&rsquo;s servants, and in the sight of the people.</p>
      <p>11:4 And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:</p>
      <p>11:5 And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.</p>
      <p>11:6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.</p>
      <p>11:7 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.</p>
      <p>11:8 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.</p>
      <p>11:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>11:10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.</p>

      <p>12:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying,</p>
      <p>12:2 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.</p>
      <p>12:3 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:</p>
      <p>12:4 And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.</p>
      <p>12:5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:</p>
      <p>12:6 And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.</p>
      <p>12:7 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.</p>
      <p>12:8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.</p>
      <p>12:9 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.</p>
      <p>12:10 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.</p>
      <p>12:11 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD&rsquo;s passover.</p>
      <p>12:12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.</p>
      <p>12:13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>12:14 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.</p>
      <p>12:15 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.</p>
      <p>12:16 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.</p>
      <p>12:17 And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.</p>
      <p>12:18 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.</p>
      <p>12:19 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.</p>
      <p>12:20 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.</p>
      <p>12:21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.</p>
      <p>12:22 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.</p>
      <p>12:23 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.</p>
      <p>12:24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.</p>
      <p>12:25 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.</p>
      <p>12:26 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service? </p>
      <p>12:27 That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD&rsquo;s passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.</p>
      <p>12:28 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</p>
      <p>12:29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.</p>
      <p>12:30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.</p>
      <p>12:31 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.</p>
      <p>12:32 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.</p>
      <p>12:33 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.</p>
      <p>12:34 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.</p>
      <p>12:35 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:</p>
      <p>12:36 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.</p>
      <p>12:37 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.</p>
      <p>12:38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.</p>
      <p>12:39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.</p>
      <p>12:40 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.</p>
      <p>12:41 And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>12:42 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.</p>
      <p>12:43 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:</p>
      <p>12:44 But every man&rsquo;s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.</p>
      <p>12:45 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.</p>
      <p>12:46 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.</p>
      <p>12:47 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.</p>
      <p>12:48 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.</p>
      <p>12:49 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.</p>
      <p>12:50 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</p>
      <p>12:51 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.</p>
      <p>13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>13:2 Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.</p>
      <p>13:3 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.</p>
      <p>13:4 This day came ye out in the month Abib.</p>
      <p>13:5 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.</p>

      <p>13:6 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD.</p>
      <p>13:7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.</p>
      <p>13:8 And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.</p>
      <p>13:9 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD&rsquo;s law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.</p>
      <p>13:10 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.</p>

      <p>13:12 That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males shall be the LORD&rsquo;s.</p>
      <p>13:13 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.</p>
      <p>13:14 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:</p>
      <p>13:15 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.</p>
      <p>13:16 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.</p>
      <p>13:17 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:</p>
      <p>13:18 But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>13:19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.</p>
      <p>13:20 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.</p>
      <p>13:21 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:</p>
      <p>13:22 He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.</p>
      <p>14:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>14:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.</p>
      <p>14:3 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.</p>

      <p>14:4 And I will harden Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.</p>
      <p>14:5 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us? </p>

      <p>14:10 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>14:11 And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt? </p>
      <p>14:12 Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.</p>
      <p>14:13 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.</p>
      <p>14:14 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.</p>
      <p>14:15 And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:</p>
      <p>14:16 But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.</p>
      <p>14:17 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.</p>
      <p>14:18 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.</p>
      <p>14:19 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:</p>
      <p>14:20 And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.</p>
      <p>14:21 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.</p>
      <p>14:22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.</p>
      <p>14:23 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh&rsquo;s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.</p>
      <p>14:24 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,</p>
      <p>14:25 And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.</p>
      <p>14:26 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.</p>
      <p>14:27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.</p>
      <p>14:28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.</p>
      <p>14:29 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.</p>
      <p>14:30 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.</p>
      <p>14:31 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.</p>

      <p>15:1 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.</p>
      <p>15:2 The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father&rsquo;s God, and I will exalt him.</p>
      <p>15:3 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.</p>
      <p>15:4 Pharaoh&rsquo;s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.</p>
      <p>15:5 The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.</p>
      <p>15:6 Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.</p>
      <p>15:7 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble.</p>
      <p>15:8 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.</p>
      <p>15:9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.</p>
      <p>15:10 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.</p>
      <p>15:11 Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? </p>
      <p>15:12 Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.</p>
      <p>15:13 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.</p>
      <p>15:14 The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.</p>
      <p>15:15 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.</p>
      <p>15:16 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.</p>
      <p>15:17 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands have established.</p>
      <p>15:18 The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.</p>
      <p>15:19 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea.</p>
      <p>15:20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.</p>
      <p>15:21 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.</p>
      <p>15:22 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.</p>
      <p>15:23 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.</p>
      <p>15:24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? </p>
      <p>15:25 And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,</p>
      <p>15:26 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.</p>
      <p>15:27 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.</p>

      <p>16:1 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>16:2 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:</p>
      <p>16:3 And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.</p>
      <p>16:4 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.</p>
      <p>16:5 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.</p>
      <p>16:6 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:</p>
      <p>16:7 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that ye murmur against us? </p>
      <p>16:8 And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.</p>
      <p>16:9 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings.</p>
      <p>16:10 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.</p>
      <p>16:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>16:12 I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.</p>
      <p>16:13 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.</p>
      <p>16:14 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.</p>
      <p>16:15 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.</p>
      <p>16:16 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents.</p>
      <p>16:17 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.</p>
      <p>16:18 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.</p>
      <p>16:19 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.</p>
      <p>16:20 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.</p>
      <p>16:21 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.</p>
      <p>16:22 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.</p>
      <p>16:23 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.</p>
      <p>16:24 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.</p>
      <p>16:25 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.</p>
      <p>16:26 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.</p>
      <p>16:27 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.</p>
      <p>16:28 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? </p>
      <p>16:29 See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.</p>
      <p>16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.</p>
      <p>16:31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.</p>
      <p>16:32 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>16:33 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.</p>
      <p>16:34 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.</p>
      <p>16:35 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.</p>
      <p>16:36 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.</p>

      <p>17:1 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink.</p>
      <p>17:2 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD? </p>
      <p>17:3 And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst? </p>
      <p>17:4 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me.</p>
      <p>17:5 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.</p>
      <p>17:6 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.</p>
      <p>17:7 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not? </p>
      <p>17:8 Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.</p>
      <p>17:9 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.</p>
      <p>17:10 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.</p>
      <p>17:11 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.</p>
      <p>17:12 But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.</p>
      <p>17:13 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.</p>
      <p>17:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.</p>
      <p>17:15 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:</p>
      <p>17:16 For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.</p>

      <p>18:1 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses&rsquo; father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;</p>
      <p>18:2 Then Jethro, Moses&rsquo; father in law, took Zipporah, Moses&rsquo; wife, after he had sent her back,</p>
      <p>18:3 And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:</p>
      <p>18:4 And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:</p>
      <p>18:5 And Jethro, Moses&rsquo; father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:</p>
      <p>18:6 And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.</p>
      <p>18:7 And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.</p>
      <p>18:8 And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel&rsquo;s sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.</p>
      <p>18:9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.</p>
      <p>18:10 And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.</p>
      <p>18:11 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.</p>
      <p>18:12 And Jethro, Moses&rsquo; father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses&rsquo; father in law before God.</p>
      <p>18:13 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.</p>
      <p>18:14 And when Moses&rsquo; father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even? </p>
      <p>18:15 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God:</p>
      <p>18:16 When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.</p>
      <p>18:17 And Moses&rsquo; father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.</p>
      <p>18:18 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.</p>
      <p>18:19 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:</p>
      <p>18:20 And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.</p>
      <p>18:21 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:</p>
      <p>18:22 And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.</p>
      <p>18:23 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.</p>
      <p>18:24 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.</p>
      <p>18:25 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.</p>
      <p>18:26 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.</p>
      <p>18:27 And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.</p>

      <p>19:1 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.</p>
      <p>19:2 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount.</p>
      <p>19:3 And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;</p>
      <p>19:4 Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles&rsquo; wings, and brought you unto myself.</p>
      <p>19:5 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:</p>
      <p>19:6 And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.</p>
      <p>19:7 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.</p>
      <p>19:8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>19:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>19:10 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,</p>
      <p>19:11 And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.</p>
      <p>19:12 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:</p>
      <p>19:13 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.</p>
      <p>19:14 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.</p>
      <p>19:15 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.</p>
      <p>19:16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.</p>
      <p>19:17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.</p>
      <p>19:18 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.</p>
      <p>19:19 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.</p>
      <p>19:20 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.</p>
      <p>19:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.</p>
      <p>19:22 And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.</p>
      <p>19:23 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.</p>
      <p>19:24 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.</p>
      <p>19:25 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.</p>

      <p>20:1 And God spake all these words, saying,</p>
      <p>20:2 I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</p>
      <p>20:3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</p>
      <p>20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.</p>
      <p>20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;</p>
      <p>20:6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.</p>
      <p>20:7 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</p>
      <p>20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.</p>
      <p>20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:</p>
      <p>20:10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:</p>
      <p>20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p>
      <p>20:12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</p>
      <p>20:13 Thou shalt not kill.</p>
      <p>20:14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.</p>
      <p>20:15 Thou shalt not steal.</p>
      <p>20:16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.</p>
      <p>20:17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour&rsquo;s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour&rsquo;s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour&rsquo;s.</p>
      <p>20:18 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.</p>
      <p>20:19 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.</p>
      <p>20:20 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.</p>
      <p>20:21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.</p>
      <p>20:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.</p>
      <p>20:23 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.</p>
      <p>20:24 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.</p>
      <p>20:25 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.</p>
      <p>20:26 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.</p>

      <p>21:1 Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.</p>
      <p>21:2 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.</p>
      <p>21:3 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him.</p>
      <p>21:4 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master&rsquo;s, and he shall go out by himself.</p>
      <p>21:5 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:</p>
      <p>21:6 Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.</p>
      <p>21:7 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.</p>
      <p>21:8 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.</p>
      <p>21:9 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.</p>
      <p>21:10 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.</p>
      <p>21:11 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money.</p>
      <p>21:12 He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.</p>
      <p>21:13 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.</p>
      <p>21:14 But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.</p>
      <p>21:15 And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.</p>
      <p>21:16 And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.</p>
      <p>21:17 And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.</p>
      <p>21:18 And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:</p>
      <p>21:19 If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.</p>
      <p>21:20 And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.</p>
      <p>21:21 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.</p>
      <p>21:22 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman&rsquo;s husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.</p>
      <p>21:23 And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,</p>
      <p>21:24 Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,</p>
      <p>21:25 Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.</p>
      <p>21:26 And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye&rsquo;s sake.</p>
      <p>21:27 And if he smite out his manservant&rsquo;s tooth, or his maidservant&rsquo;s tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth&rsquo;s sake.</p>
      <p>21:28 If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.</p>
      <p>21:29 But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.</p>
      <p>21:30 If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.</p>
      <p>21:31 Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.</p>
      <p>21:32 If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.</p>
      <p>21:33 And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;</p>
      <p>21:34 The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his.</p>
      <p>21:35 And if one man&rsquo;s ox hurt another&rsquo;s, that he die; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they shall divide.</p>
      <p>21:36 Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own.</p>

      <p>22:1 If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.</p>
      <p>22:2 If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him.</p>
      <p>22:3 If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.</p>
      <p>22:4 If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.</p>
      <p>22:5 If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man&rsquo;s field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.</p>
      <p>22:6 If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.</p>
      <p>22:7 If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man&rsquo;s house; if the thief be found, let him pay double.</p>
      <p>22:8 If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour&rsquo;s goods.</p>
      <p>22:9 For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour.</p>
      <p>22:10 If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:</p>
      <p>22:11 Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour&rsquo;s goods; and the owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good.</p>
      <p>22:12 And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.</p>
      <p>22:13 If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and he shall not make good that which was torn.</p>
      <p>22:14 And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good.</p>
      <p>22:15 But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.</p>
      <p>22:16 And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.</p>
      <p>22:17 If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.</p>
      <p>22:18 Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.</p>
      <p>22:19 Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.</p>
      <p>22:20 He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.</p>
      <p>22:21 Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>22:22 Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.</p>
      <p>22:23 If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;</p>
      <p>22:24 And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.</p>
      <p>22:25 If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.</p>
      <p>22:26 If thou at all take thy neighbour&rsquo;s raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:</p>
      <p>22:27 For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.</p>
      <p>22:28 Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.</p>
      <p>22:29 Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.</p>
      <p>22:30 Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.</p>
      <p>22:31 And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.</p>

      <p>23:1 Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.</p>
      <p>23:2 Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment:</p>
      <p>23:3 Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.</p>
      <p>23:4 If thou meet thine enemy&rsquo;s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.</p>
      <p>23:5 If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.</p>
      <p>23:6 Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.</p>
      <p>23:7 Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.</p>
      <p>23:8 And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.</p>
      <p>23:9 Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>23:10 And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof:</p>
      <p>23:11 But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.</p>
      <p>23:12 Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.</p>
      <p>23:13 And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.</p>
      <p>23:14 Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.</p>
      <p>23:15 Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)</p>
      <p>23:16 And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.</p>
      <p>23:17 Three items in the year all thy males shall appear before the LORD God.</p>
      <p>23:18 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.</p>
      <p>23:19 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother&rsquo;s milk.</p>
      <p>23:20 Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.</p>
      <p>23:21 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.</p>
      <p>23:22 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.</p>
      <p>23:23 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.</p>
      <p>23:24 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.</p>
      <p>23:25 And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.</p>
      <p>23:26 There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.</p>
      <p>23:27 I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.</p>
      <p>23:28 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.</p>
      <p>23:29 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.</p>
      <p>23:30 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.</p>
      <p>23:31 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee.</p>
      <p>23:32 Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.</p>
      <p>23:33 They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.</p>

      <p>24:1 And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off.</p>
      <p>24:2 And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.</p>

      <p>24:5 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>24:6 And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.</p>

      <p>24:9 Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:</p>
      <p>24:10 And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.</p>
      <p>24:11 And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.</p>
      <p>24:12 And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.</p>
      <p>24:13 And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God.</p>
      <p>24:14 And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.</p>
      <p>24:15 And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.</p>
      <p>24:16 And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.</p>
      <p>24:17 And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.</p>
      <p>24:18 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.</p>

      <p>25:3 And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver, and brass,</p>
      <p>25:4 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats&rsquo; hair,</p>

      <p>29:1 And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto me in the priest&rsquo;s office: Take one young bullock, and two rams without blemish,</p>
      <p>29:2 And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour shalt thou make them.</p>
      <p>29:3 And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams.</p>
      <p>29:4 And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with water.</p>
      <p>29:5 And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod:</p>
      <p>29:6 And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the mitre.</p>
      <p>29:7 Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his head, and anoint him.</p>
      <p>29:8 And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them.</p>
      <p>29:9 And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and put the bonnets on them: and the priest&rsquo;s office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons.</p>
      <p>29:10 And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock.</p>
      <p>29:11 And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
      <p>29:12 And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar.</p>
      <p>29:13 And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar.</p>
      <p>29:14 But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin offering.</p>
      <p>29:15 Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.</p>
      <p>29:16 And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood, and sprinkle it round about upon the altar.</p>
      <p>29:17 And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him, and his legs, and put them unto his pieces, and unto his head.</p>
      <p>29:18 And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt offering unto the LORD: it is a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>29:19 And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.</p>
      <p>29:20 Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.</p>
      <p>29:21 And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons&rsquo; garments with him.</p>
      <p>29:22 Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration:</p>
      <p>29:23 And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the LORD:</p>
      <p>29:24 And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the LORD.</p>
      <p>29:25 And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>29:26 And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron&rsquo;s consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and it shall be thy part.</p>
      <p>29:27 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:</p>
      <p>29:28 And it shall be Aaron&rsquo;s and his sons&rsquo; by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave offering unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>29:29 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons&rsquo; after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.</p>
      <p>29:30 And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place.</p>
      <p>29:31 And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place.</p>
      <p>29:32 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
      <p>29:33 And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy.</p>
      <p>29:34 And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.</p>
      <p>29:35 And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them.</p>
      <p>29:36 And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.</p>
      <p>29:37 Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy.</p>
      <p>29:38 Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually.</p>
      <p>29:39 The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even:</p>
      <p>29:40 And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering.</p>
      <p>29:41 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>29:42 This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee.</p>
      <p>29:43 And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.</p>
      <p>29:44 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest&rsquo;s office.</p>
      <p>29:45 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.</p>
      <p>29:46 And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the LORD their God.</p>

      <p>30:1 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim wood shalt thou make it.</p>
      <p>30:2 A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same.</p>
      <p>30:3 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.</p>
      <p>30:4 And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal.</p>
      <p>30:5 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.</p>
      <p>30:6 And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.</p>
      <p>30:7 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.</p>
      <p>30:8 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations.</p>
      <p>30:9 Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.</p>
      <p>30:10 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>30:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>30:12 When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them.</p>
      <p>30:13 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD.</p>
      <p>30:14 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>30:15 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.</p>
      <p>30:16 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.</p>
      <p>30:17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>30:18 Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.</p>
      <p>30:19 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:</p>
      <p>30:20 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD:</p>
      <p>30:21 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.</p>
      <p>30:22 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>30:23 Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,</p>
      <p>30:24 And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:</p>
      <p>30:25 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil.</p>
      <p>30:26 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony,</p>
      <p>30:27 And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense,</p>
      <p>30:28 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot.</p>
      <p>30:29 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.</p>
      <p>30:30 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister unto me in the priest&rsquo;s office.</p>
      <p>30:31 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.</p>
      <p>30:32 Upon man&rsquo;s flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you.</p>
      <p>30:33 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.</p>
      <p>30:34 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight:</p>
      <p>30:35 And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy:</p>
      <p>30:36 And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.</p>
      <p>30:37 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD.</p>
      <p>30:38 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.</p>

      <p>31:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>31:2 See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:</p>
      <p>31:3 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,</p>
      <p>31:4 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,</p>
      <p>31:5 And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.</p>
      <p>31:6 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee;</p>
      <p>31:7 The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle,</p>
      <p>31:8 And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,</p>
      <p>31:9 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot,</p>
      <p>31:10 And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest&rsquo;s office,</p>
      <p>31:11 And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.</p>
      <p>31:12 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>31:13 Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.</p>
      <p>31:14 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</p>
      <p>31:15 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.</p>
      <p>31:16 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.</p>
      <p>31:17 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.</p>
      <p>31:18 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.</p>

      <p>32:1 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.</p>
      <p>32:2 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.</p>
      <p>32:3 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.</p>
      <p>32:4 And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>32:5 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.</p>
      <p>32:6 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.</p>
      <p>32:7 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:</p>
      <p>32:8 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>32:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:</p>
      <p>32:10 Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.</p>
      <p>32:11 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?</p>
      <p>32:12 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.</p>
      <p>32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.</p>
      <p>32:14 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.</p>
      <p>32:15 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.</p>
      <p>32:16 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.</p>
      <p>32:17 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.</p>
      <p>32:18 And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.</p>
      <p>32:19 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses&rsquo; anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.</p>
      <p>32:20 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.</p>
      <p>32:21 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them? </p>
      <p>32:22 And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief.</p>
      <p>32:23 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.</p>
      <p>32:24 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.</p>
      <p>32:25 And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)</p>
      <p>32:26 Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD&rsquo;s side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.</p>
      <p>32:27 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.</p>
      <p>32:28 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.</p>
      <p>32:29 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.</p>
      <p>32:30 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.</p>
      <p>32:31 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.</p>
      <p>32:32 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.</p>
      <p>32:33 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.</p>
      <p>32:34 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.</p>
      <p>32:35 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.</p>

      <p>33:2 And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:</p>

      <p>33:5 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.</p>
      <p>33:6 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.</p>
      <p>33:7 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.</p>
      <p>33:8 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.</p>
      <p>33:9 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.</p>
      <p>33:10 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door.</p>
      <p>33:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.</p>
      <p>33:12 And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.</p>
      <p>33:13 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.</p>
      <p>33:14 And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.</p>
      <p>33:15 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.</p>
      <p>33:16 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.</p>
      <p>33:17 And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.</p>
      <p>33:18 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.</p>
      <p>33:19 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.</p>
      <p>33:20 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.</p>
      <p>33:21 And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:</p>
      <p>33:22 And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:</p>
      <p>33:23 And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.</p>

      <p>34:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.</p>
      <p>34:2 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.</p>
      <p>34:3 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.</p>
      <p>34:4 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.</p>
      <p>34:5 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.</p>
      <p>34:6 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,</p>
      <p>34:7 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children&rsquo;s children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.</p>
      <p>34:8 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.</p>
      <p>34:9 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let my LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.</p>
      <p>34:10 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.</p>
      <p>34:11 Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.</p>
      <p>34:12 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:</p>
      <p>34:13 But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:</p>
      <p>34:14 For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:</p>
      <p>34:15 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;</p>
      <p>34:16 And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.</p>
      <p>34:17 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.</p>
      <p>34:18 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.</p>
      <p>34:19 All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.</p>
      <p>34:20 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.</p>
      <p>34:21 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.</p>
      <p>34:22 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year&rsquo;s end.</p>
      <p>34:23 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel.</p>
      <p>34:24 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year.</p>
      <p>34:25 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.</p>
      <p>34:26 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother&rsquo;s milk.</p>
      <p>34:27 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.</p>
      <p>34:28 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.</p>
      <p>34:29 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses&rsquo; hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.</p>
      <p>34:30 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.</p>
      <p>34:31 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.</p>
      <p>34:32 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai.</p>
      <p>34:33 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face.</p>
      <p>34:34 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.</p>
      <p>34:35 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses&rsquo; face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.</p>

      <p>35:1 And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said unto them, These are the words which the LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them.</p>
      <p>35:2 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death.</p>
      <p>35:3 Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.</p>
      <p>35:4 And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying,</p>
      <p>35:5 Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and silver, and brass,</p>
      <p>35:6 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats&rsquo; hair,</p>

      <p>35:11 The tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets,</p>
      <p>35:12 The ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat, and the vail of the covering,</p>
      <p>35:13 The table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the shewbread,</p>
      <p>35:14 The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his lamps, with the oil for the light,</p>
      <p>35:15 And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle,</p>
      <p>35:16 The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,</p>
      <p>35:17 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court,</p>
      <p>35:18 The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords,</p>
      <p>35:19 The cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest&rsquo;s office.</p>
      <p>35:20 And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.</p>
      <p>35:21 And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD&rsquo;s offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments.</p>
      <p>35:22 And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>35:23 And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats&rsquo; hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers&rsquo; skins, brought them.</p>
      <p>35:24 Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the LORD&rsquo;s offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it.</p>
      <p>35:25 And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.</p>
      <p>35:26 And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats&rsquo; hair.</p>
      <p>35:27 And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate;</p>
      <p>35:28 And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.</p>

      <p>35:33 And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.</p>
      <p>35:34 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.</p>
      <p>35:35 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work.</p>

      <p>36:1 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded.</p>
      <p>36:2 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:</p>
      <p>36:3 And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.</p>
      <p>36:4 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;</p>
      <p>36:5 And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.</p>
      <p>36:6 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.</p>
      <p>36:7 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.</p>
      <p>36:8 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.</p>
      <p>36:9 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.</p>
      <p>36:10 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another.</p>
      <p>36:11 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.</p>
      <p>36:12 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one curtain to another.</p>
      <p>36:13 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.</p>
      <p>36:14 And he made curtains of goats&rsquo; hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.</p>
      <p>36:15 The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.</p>
      <p>36:16 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.</p>
      <p>36:17 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.</p>
      <p>36:18 And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one.</p>
      <p>36:19 And he made a covering for the tent of rams&rsquo; skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers&rsquo; skins above that.</p>
      <p>36:20 And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up.</p>
      <p>36:21 The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half.</p>
      <p>36:22 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.</p>
      <p>36:23 And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward:</p>
      <p>36:24 And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons.</p>
      <p>36:25 And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north corner, he made twenty boards,</p>
      <p>36:26 And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.</p>
      <p>36:27 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.</p>
      <p>36:28 And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.</p>
      <p>36:29 And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.</p>
      <p>36:30 And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.</p>
      <p>36:31 And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,</p>
      <p>36:32 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward.</p>
      <p>36:33 And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other.</p>
      <p>36:34 And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.</p>
      <p>36:35 And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work.</p>
      <p>36:36 And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver.</p>
      <p>36:37 And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework;</p>
      <p>36:38 And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets were of brass.</p>

      <p>37:2 And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about.</p>
      <p>37:3 And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of it.</p>

      <p>37:14 Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table.</p>
      <p>37:15 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table.</p>

      <p>37:25 And he made the incense altar of shittim wood: the length of it was a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was foursquare; and two cubits was the height of it; the horns thereof were of the same.</p>
      <p>37:26 And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it a crown of gold round about.</p>
      <p>37:27 And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places for the staves to bear it withal.</p>
      <p>37:28 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.</p>
      <p>37:29 And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary.</p>

      <p>38:1 And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood: five cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof; it was foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof.</p>
      <p>38:2 And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.</p>
      <p>38:3 And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all the vessels thereof made he of brass.</p>
      <p>38:4 And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it.</p>
      <p>38:5 And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, to be places for the staves.</p>
      <p>38:6 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with brass.</p>
      <p>38:7 And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, to bear it withal; he made the altar hollow with boards.</p>
      <p>38:8 And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass, of the lookingglasses of the women assembling, which assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
      <p>38:9 And he made the court: on the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, an hundred cubits:</p>
      <p>38:10 Their pillars were twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.</p>
      <p>38:11 And for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits, their pillars were twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver.</p>
      <p>38:12 And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver.</p>
      <p>38:13 And for the east side eastward fifty cubits.</p>
      <p>38:14 The hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three.</p>
      <p>38:15 And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and that hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three.</p>
      <p>38:16 All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen.</p>
      <p>38:17 And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of their chapiters of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver.</p>
      <p>38:18 And the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court.</p>
      <p>38:19 And their pillars were four, and their sockets of brass four; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters and their fillets of silver.</p>
      <p>38:20 And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of brass.</p>
      <p>38:21 This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron the priest.</p>
      <p>38:22 And Bezaleel the son Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
      <p>38:23 And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.</p>
      <p>38:24 All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary.</p>
      <p>38:25 And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:</p>
      <p>38:26 A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men.</p>
      <p>38:27 And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.</p>
      <p>38:28 And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and filleted them.</p>
      <p>38:29 And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels.</p>
      <p>38:30 And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the brasen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar,</p>
      <p>38:31 And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.</p>

      <p>39:1 And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
      <p>39:2 And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.</p>
      <p>39:3 And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cunning work.</p>
      <p>39:4 They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the two edges was it coupled together.</p>
      <p>39:5 And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
      <p>39:6 And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel.</p>
      <p>39:7 And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
      <p>39:8 And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.</p>
      <p>39:9 It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled.</p>
      <p>39:10 And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.</p>
      <p>39:11 And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.</p>
      <p>39:12 And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.</p>
      <p>39:13 And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.</p>
      <p>39:14 And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.</p>
      <p>39:15 And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of wreathen work of pure gold.</p>
      <p>39:16 And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.</p>
      <p>39:17 And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate.</p>
      <p>39:18 And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it.</p>
      <p>39:19 And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod inward.</p>
      <p>39:20 And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.</p>
      <p>39:21 And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
      <p>39:22 And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.</p>
      <p>39:23 And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend.</p>
      <p>39:24 And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.</p>
      <p>39:25 And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates;</p>
      <p>39:26 A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
      <p>39:27 And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,</p>
      <p>39:28 And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen,</p>
      <p>39:29 And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
      <p>39:30 And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.</p>
      <p>39:31 And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
      <p>39:32 Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.</p>
      <p>39:33 And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his sockets,</p>
      <p>39:34 And the covering of rams&rsquo; skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers&rsquo; skins, and the vail of the covering,</p>
      <p>39:35 The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat,</p>
      <p>39:36 The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread,</p>
      <p>39:37 The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light,</p>
      <p>39:38 And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door,</p>
      <p>39:39 The brasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,</p>
      <p>39:40 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation,</p>
      <p>39:41 The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons&rsquo; garments, to minister in the priest&rsquo;s office.</p>
      <p>39:42 According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work.</p>
      <p>39:43 And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.</p>

      <p>40:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>40:2 On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.</p>
      <p>40:3 And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail.</p>
      <p>40:4 And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.</p>
      <p>40:5 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.</p>
      <p>40:6 And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.</p>
      <p>40:7 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.</p>
      <p>40:8 And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate.</p>
      <p>40:9 And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.</p>
      <p>40:10 And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.</p>
      <p>40:11 And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.</p>
      <p>40:12 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.</p>
      <p>40:13 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest&rsquo;s office.</p>
      <p>40:14 And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:</p>
      <p>40:15 And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest&rsquo;s office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.</p>
      <p>40:16 Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.</p>
      <p>40:17 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.</p>
      <p>40:18 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars.</p>
      <p>40:19 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
      <p>40:20 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:</p>
      <p>40:21 And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
      <p>40:22 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.</p>
      <p>40:23 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.</p>
      <p>40:24 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.</p>
      <p>40:25 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
      <p>40:26 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail:</p>
      <p>40:27 And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
      <p>40:28 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.</p>
      <p>40:29 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
      <p>40:30 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.</p>
      <p>40:31 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:</p>
      <p>40:32 When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
      <p>40:33 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.</p>
      <p>40:34 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</p>
      <p>40:35 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</p>
      <p>40:36 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:</p>
      <p>40:37 But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.</p>
      <p>40:38 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.</p>

      <p>1:1 And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,</p>
      <p>1:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the flock.</p>
      <p>1:3 If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.</p>
      <p>1:4 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.</p>
      <p>1:5 And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron&rsquo;s sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
      <p>1:6 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.</p>
      <p>1:7 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire:</p>
      <p>1:8 And the priests, Aaron&rsquo;s sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:</p>
      <p>1:9 But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>1:10 And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.</p>
      <p>1:11 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron&rsquo;s sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar.</p>
      <p>1:12 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:</p>
      <p>1:13 But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>1:14 And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.</p>
      <p>1:15 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:</p>
      <p>1:16 And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes:</p>
      <p>1:17 And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>

      <p>4:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>4:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them:</p>
      <p>4:3 If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering.</p>
      <p>4:4 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock&rsquo;s head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.</p>
      <p>4:5 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock&rsquo;s blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:</p>
      <p>4:6 And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary.</p>
      <p>4:7 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
      <p>4:8 And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,</p>
      <p>4:9 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away,</p>
      <p>4:10 As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering.</p>
      <p>4:11 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,</p>
      <p>4:12 Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.</p>
      <p>4:13 And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty;</p>
      <p>4:14 When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
      <p>4:15 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD.</p>
      <p>4:16 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock&rsquo;s blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:</p>
      <p>4:17 And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the vail.</p>
      <p>4:18 And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
      <p>4:19 And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the altar.</p>
      <p>4:20 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.</p>
      <p>4:21 And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the congregation.</p>
      <p>4:22 When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty;</p>
      <p>4:23 Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish:</p>
      <p>4:24 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin offering.</p>
      <p>4:25 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering.</p>

      <p>4:28 Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned.</p>
      <p>4:29 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.</p>
      <p>4:30 And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.</p>
      <p>4:31 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.</p>
      <p>4:32 And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish.</p>
      <p>4:33 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering.</p>
      <p>4:34 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar:</p>
      <p>4:35 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.</p>

      <p>5:17 And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wist it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.</p>
      <p>5:18 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him.</p>

      <p>7:5 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a trespass offering.</p>
      <p>7:6 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in the holy place: it is most holy.</p>
      <p>7:7 As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it.</p>
      <p>7:8 And the priest that offereth any man&rsquo;s burnt offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered.</p>
      <p>7:9 And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest&rsquo;s that offereth it.</p>
      <p>7:10 And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.</p>
      <p>7:11 And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>7:12 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.</p>
      <p>7:13 Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.</p>
      <p>7:14 And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest&rsquo;s that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.</p>
      <p>7:15 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.</p>
      <p>7:16 But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:</p>
      <p>7:17 But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.</p>
      <p>7:18 And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.</p>
      <p>7:19 And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof.</p>
      <p>7:20 But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.</p>
      <p>7:21 Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.</p>
      <p>7:22 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>7:23 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.</p>
      <p>7:24 And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall in no wise eat of it.</p>
      <p>7:25 For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people.</p>
      <p>7:26 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.</p>
      <p>7:27 Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.</p>
      <p>7:28 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>7:29 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace offerings.</p>
      <p>7:30 His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD.</p>
      <p>7:31 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron&rsquo;s and his sons&rsquo;.</p>
      <p>7:32 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.</p>
      <p>7:33 He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.</p>
      <p>7:34 For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel.</p>
      <p>7:35 This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest&rsquo;s office;</p>
      <p>7:36 Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their generations.</p>
      <p>7:37 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;</p>
      <p>7:38 Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.</p>

      <p>8:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>8:2 Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;</p>
      <p>8:3 And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
      <p>8:4 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
      <p>8:5 And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the LORD commanded to be done.</p>
      <p>8:6 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.</p>
      <p>8:7 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.</p>
      <p>8:8 And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.</p>
      <p>8:9 And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
      <p>8:10 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.</p>
      <p>8:11 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.</p>
      <p>8:12 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron&rsquo;s head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.</p>
      <p>8:13 And Moses brought Aaron&rsquo;s sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
      <p>8:14 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering.</p>
      <p>8:15 And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.</p>
      <p>8:16 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned it upon the altar.</p>
      <p>8:17 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
      <p>8:18 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.</p>
      <p>8:19 And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.</p>
      <p>8:20 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.</p>
      <p>8:21 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour, and an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
      <p>8:22 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.</p>
      <p>8:23 And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it upon the tip of Aaron&rsquo;s right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.</p>
      <p>8:24 And he brought Aaron&rsquo;s sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.</p>
      <p>8:25 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:</p>
      <p>8:26 And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the right shoulder:</p>
      <p>8:27 And he put all upon Aaron&rsquo;s hands, and upon his sons&rsquo; hands, and waved them for a wave offering before the LORD.</p>
      <p>8:28 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>8:29 And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses&rsquo; part; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
      <p>8:30 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons&rsquo; garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons&rsquo; garments with him.</p>
      <p>8:31 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.</p>
      <p>8:32 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.</p>
      <p>8:33 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.</p>
      <p>8:34 As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to make an atonement for you.</p>
      <p>8:35 Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.</p>
      <p>8:36 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.</p>

      <p>9:1 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;</p>
      <p>9:2 And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.</p>
      <p>9:3 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;</p>
      <p>9:4 Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you.</p>
      <p>9:5 And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.</p>
      <p>9:6 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.</p>
      <p>9:7 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.</p>
      <p>9:8 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.</p>
      <p>9:9 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:</p>
      <p>9:10 But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
      <p>9:11 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.</p>
      <p>9:12 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron&rsquo;s sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.</p>
      <p>9:13 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.</p>
      <p>9:14 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar.</p>
      <p>9:15 And he brought the people&rsquo;s offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.</p>
      <p>9:16 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.</p>
      <p>9:17 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.</p>
      <p>9:18 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron&rsquo;s sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,</p>
      <p>9:19 And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:</p>
      <p>9:20 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:</p>
      <p>9:21 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.</p>
      <p>9:22 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.</p>
      <p>9:23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.</p>
      <p>9:24 And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.</p>

      <p>10:1 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.</p>
      <p>10:2 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD.</p>
      <p>10:3 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.</p>
      <p>10:4 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.</p>
      <p>10:5 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.</p>
      <p>10:6 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.</p>
      <p>10:7 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.</p>
      <p>10:8 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,</p>
      <p>10:9 Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:</p>
      <p>10:10 And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;</p>
      <p>10:11 And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.</p>
      <p>10:12 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:</p>
      <p>10:13 And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons&rsquo; due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.</p>
      <p>10:14 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be thy due, and thy sons&rsquo; due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.</p>
      <p>10:15 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons&rsquo; with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.</p>
      <p>10:16 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,</p>
      <p>10:17 Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD? </p>
      <p>10:18 Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.</p>
      <p>10:19 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD? </p>
      <p>10:20 And when Moses heard that, he was content.</p>

      <p>11:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.</p>
      <p>11:3 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.</p>
      <p>11:4 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.</p>
      <p>11:5 And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.</p>
      <p>11:6 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.</p>
      <p>11:7 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.</p>
      <p>11:8 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you.</p>
      <p>11:9 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.</p>
      <p>11:10 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you:</p>
      <p>11:11 They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.</p>
      <p>11:12 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.</p>
      <p>11:13 And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,</p>
      <p>11:14 And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;</p>
      <p>11:15 Every raven after his kind;</p>

      <p>11:18 And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,</p>
      <p>11:19 And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.</p>
      <p>11:20 All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an abomination unto you.</p>
      <p>11:21 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth;</p>
      <p>11:22 Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.</p>
      <p>11:23 But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, shall be an abomination unto you.</p>
      <p>11:24 And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.</p>
      <p>11:25 And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.</p>
      <p>11:26 The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.</p>
      <p>11:27 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.</p>

      <p>11:34 Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean.</p>
      <p>11:35 And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: for they are unclean and shall be unclean unto you.</p>
      <p>11:36 Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean.</p>
      <p>11:37 And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it shall be clean.</p>
      <p>11:38 But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.</p>
      <p>11:39 And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.</p>
      <p>11:40 And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.</p>
      <p>11:41 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an abomination; it shall not be eaten.</p>
      <p>11:42 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination.</p>
      <p>11:43 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.</p>
      <p>11:44 For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</p>
      <p>11:45 For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.</p>
      <p>11:46 This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:</p>
      <p>11:47 To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.</p>

      <p>12:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>12:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.</p>
      <p>12:3 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.</p>

      <p>12:7 Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is the law for her that hath born a male or a female.</p>

      <p>13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,</p>
      <p>13:2 When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:</p>
      <p>13:3 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.</p>
      <p>13:4 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days:</p>
      <p>13:5 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:</p>
      <p>13:6 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.</p>
      <p>13:7 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again.</p>
      <p>13:8 And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.</p>
      <p>13:9 When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;</p>
      <p>13:10 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising;</p>
      <p>13:11 It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he is unclean.</p>
      <p>13:12 And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;</p>
      <p>13:13 Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.</p>
      <p>13:14 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.</p>
      <p>13:15 And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.</p>
      <p>13:16 Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest;</p>
      <p>13:17 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean.</p>
      <p>13:18 The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed,</p>
      <p>13:19 And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest;</p>
      <p>13:20 And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil.</p>
      <p>13:21 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:</p>
      <p>13:22 And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.</p>
      <p>13:23 But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.</p>
      <p>13:24 Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white;</p>
      <p>13:25 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.</p>
      <p>13:26 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:</p>
      <p>13:27 And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.</p>
      <p>13:28 And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the burning.</p>
      <p>13:29 If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;</p>
      <p>13:30 Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scall, even a leprosy upon the head or beard.</p>
      <p>13:31 And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days:</p>
      <p>13:32 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the skin;</p>
      <p>13:33 He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:</p>
      <p>13:34 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.</p>
      <p>13:35 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;</p>
      <p>13:36 Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is unclean.</p>
      <p>13:37 But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.</p>
      <p>13:38 If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, even white bright spots;</p>
      <p>13:39 Then the priest shall look: and, behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be darkish white; it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean.</p>
      <p>13:40 And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he clean.</p>
      <p>13:41 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.</p>
      <p>13:42 And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead.</p>
      <p>13:43 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising of the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;</p>
      <p>13:44 He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.</p>
      <p>13:45 And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.</p>
      <p>13:46 All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his habitation be.</p>
      <p>13:47 The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woollen garment, or a linen garment;</p>
      <p>13:48 Whether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;</p>
      <p>13:49 And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest:</p>
      <p>13:50 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up it that hath the plague seven days:</p>
      <p>13:51 And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or in any work that is made of skin; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.</p>
      <p>13:52 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.</p>
      <p>13:53 And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;</p>
      <p>13:54 Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:</p>
      <p>13:55 And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret inward, whether it be bare within or without.</p>
      <p>13:56 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:</p>
      <p>13:57 And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire.</p>
      <p>13:58 And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.</p>
      <p>13:59 This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.</p>

      <p>14:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>14:2 This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest:</p>
      <p>14:3 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper;</p>
      <p>14:4 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:</p>
      <p>14:5 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water:</p>
      <p>14:6 As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water:</p>
      <p>14:7 And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.</p>
      <p>14:8 And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.</p>
      <p>14:9 But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.</p>
      <p>14:10 And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.</p>
      <p>14:11 And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:</p>
      <p>14:12 And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD:</p>
      <p>14:13 And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering is the priest&rsquo;s, so is the trespass offering: it is most holy:</p>
      <p>14:14 And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:</p>
      <p>14:15 And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand:</p>
      <p>14:16 And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD:</p>
      <p>14:17 And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering:</p>
      <p>14:18 And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest&rsquo;s hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD.</p>
      <p>14:19 And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering:</p>
      <p>14:20 And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean.</p>
      <p>14:21 And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil;</p>
      <p>14:22 And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a burnt offering.</p>

      <p>14:28 And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering:</p>
      <p>14:29 And the rest of the oil that is in the priest&rsquo;s hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for him before the LORD.</p>
      <p>14:30 And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons, such as he can get;</p>
      <p>14:31 Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD.</p>
      <p>14:32 This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing.</p>
      <p>14:33 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</p>
      <p>14:34 When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;</p>
      <p>14:35 And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house:</p>
      <p>14:36 Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house:</p>
      <p>14:37 And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;</p>
      <p>14:38 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days:</p>
      <p>14:39 And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house;</p>
      <p>14:40 Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city:</p>
      <p>14:41 And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place:</p>
      <p>14:42 And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall plaister the house.</p>
      <p>14:43 And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plaistered;</p>
      <p>14:44 Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house; it is unclean.</p>
      <p>14:45 And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.</p>
      <p>14:46 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.</p>
      <p>14:47 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.</p>
      <p>14:48 And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.</p>
      <p>14:49 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:</p>
      <p>14:50 And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:</p>
      <p>14:51 And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:</p>
      <p>14:52 And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:</p>
      <p>14:53 But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean.</p>
      <p>14:54 This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall,</p>
      <p>14:55 And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,</p>
      <p>14:56 And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:</p>
      <p>14:57 To teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy.</p>

      <p>15:4 Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean: and every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.</p>
      <p>15:5 And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.</p>
      <p>15:6 And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.</p>
      <p>15:7 And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.</p>
      <p>15:8 And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean; then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.</p>
      <p>15:9 And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue shall be unclean.</p>
      <p>15:10 And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the even: and he that beareth any of those things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.</p>
      <p>15:11 And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue, and hath not rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.</p>
      <p>15:12 And the vessel of earth, that he toucheth which hath the issue, shall be broken: and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.</p>
      <p>15:13 And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.</p>
      <p>15:14 And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, and come before the LORD unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and give them unto the priest:</p>
      <p>15:15 And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD for his issue.</p>
      <p>15:16 And if any man&rsquo;s seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even.</p>
      <p>15:17 And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even.</p>
      <p>15:18 The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even.</p>
      <p>15:19 And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even.</p>
      <p>15:20 And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be unclean: every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean.</p>
      <p>15:21 And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.</p>
      <p>15:22 And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.</p>
      <p>15:23 And if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even.</p>
      <p>15:24 And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean.</p>
      <p>15:25 And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her separation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation: she shall be unclean.</p>
      <p>15:26 Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation.</p>
      <p>15:27 And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.</p>
      <p>15:28 But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.</p>
      <p>15:29 And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
      <p>15:30 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness.</p>
      <p>15:31 Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that is among them.</p>
      <p>15:32 This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed goeth from him, and is defiled therewith;</p>
      <p>15:33 And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean.</p>

      <p>16:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died;</p>
      <p>16:2 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.</p>
      <p>16:3 Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.</p>
      <p>16:4 He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.</p>
      <p>16:5 And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.</p>
      <p>16:6 And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.</p>
      <p>16:7 And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
      <p>16:8 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.</p>
      <p>16:9 And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD&rsquo;s lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering.</p>
      <p>16:10 But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.</p>
      <p>16:11 And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself:</p>
      <p>16:12 And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail:</p>
      <p>16:13 And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not:</p>
      <p>16:14 And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.</p>
      <p>16:15 Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:</p>
      <p>16:16 And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.</p>
      <p>16:17 And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel.</p>
      <p>16:18 And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about.</p>
      <p>16:19 And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.</p>
      <p>16:20 And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat:</p>
      <p>16:21 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness:</p>
      <p>16:22 And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.</p>
      <p>16:23 And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:</p>
      <p>16:24 And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people.</p>
      <p>16:25 And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.</p>
      <p>16:26 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp.</p>
      <p>16:27 And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.</p>
      <p>16:28 And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.</p>
      <p>16:29 And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you:</p>
      <p>16:30 For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.</p>
      <p>16:31 It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls, by a statute for ever.</p>
      <p>16:32 And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest&rsquo;s office in his father&rsquo;s stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even the holy garments:</p>
      <p>16:33 And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation.</p>
      <p>16:34 And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year. And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>

      <p>17:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>17:2 Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them; This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, saying,</p>
      <p>17:3 What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp,</p>
      <p>17:4 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:</p>
      <p>17:5 To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them for peace offerings unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>17:6 And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>17:7 And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations.</p>
      <p>17:8 And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice,</p>
      <p>17:9 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the LORD; even that man shall be cut off from among his people.</p>
      <p>17:10 And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people.</p>
      <p>17:11 For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.</p>
      <p>17:12 Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.</p>
      <p>17:13 And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.</p>
      <p>17:14 For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.</p>
      <p>17:15 And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.</p>
      <p>17:16 But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear his iniquity.</p>

      <p>18:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God.</p>
      <p>18:3 After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.</p>
      <p>18:4 Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I am the LORD your God.</p>
      <p>18:5 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.</p>
      <p>18:6 None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.</p>
      <p>18:7 The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.</p>
      <p>18:8 The nakedness of thy father&rsquo;s wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father&rsquo;s nakedness.</p>
      <p>18:9 The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.</p>
      <p>18:10 The nakedness of thy son&rsquo;s daughter, or of thy daughter&rsquo;s daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own nakedness.</p>
      <p>18:11 The nakedness of thy father&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.</p>
      <p>18:12 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father&rsquo;s sister: she is thy father&rsquo;s near kinswoman.</p>

      <p>18:14 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father&rsquo;s brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.</p>
      <p>18:15 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: she is thy son&rsquo;s wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.</p>
      <p>18:16 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother&rsquo;s wife: it is thy brother&rsquo;s nakedness.</p>
      <p>18:17 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son&rsquo;s daughter, or her daughter&rsquo;s daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.</p>
      <p>18:18 Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.</p>
      <p>18:19 Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.</p>
      <p>18:20 Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour&rsquo;s wife, to defile thyself with her.</p>

      <p>18:23 Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is confusion.</p>
      <p>18:24 Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:</p>
      <p>18:25 And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.</p>
      <p>18:26 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:</p>

      <p>19:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>19:2 Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am holy.</p>
      <p>19:3 Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.</p>
      <p>19:4 Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God.</p>
      <p>19:5 And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it at your own will.</p>
      <p>19:6 It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire.</p>
      <p>19:7 And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it shall not be accepted.</p>
      <p>19:8 Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</p>
      <p>19:9 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest.</p>

      <p>19:12 And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.</p>
      <p>19:13 Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.</p>
      <p>19:14 Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.</p>
      <p>19:15 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.</p>
      <p>19:16 Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour; I am the LORD.</p>
      <p>19:17 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.</p>
      <p>19:18 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.</p>
      <p>19:19 Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.</p>
      <p>19:20 And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.</p>
      <p>19:21 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass offering.</p>
      <p>19:22 And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him.</p>
      <p>19:23 And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.</p>
      <p>19:24 But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD withal.</p>
      <p>19:25 And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God.</p>
      <p>19:26 Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times.</p>
      <p>19:27 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.</p>
      <p>19:28 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.</p>
      <p>19:29 Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.</p>

      <p>19:32 Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD.</p>
      <p>19:33 And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him.</p>
      <p>19:34 But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.</p>
      <p>19:35 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.</p>
      <p>19:36 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>19:37 Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I am the LORD.</p>

      <p>20:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>20:2 Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.</p>
      <p>20:3 And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.</p>
      <p>20:4 And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:</p>
      <p>20:5 Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.</p>
      <p>20:6 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.</p>
      <p>20:7 Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God.</p>
      <p>20:8 And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which sanctify you.</p>
      <p>20:9 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.</p>
      <p>20:10 And the man that committeth adultery with another man&rsquo;s wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour&rsquo;s wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.</p>
      <p>20:11 And the man that lieth with his father&rsquo;s wife hath uncovered his father&rsquo;s nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.</p>
      <p>20:12 And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them.</p>
      <p>20:13 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.</p>
      <p>20:14 And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.</p>
      <p>20:15 And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast.</p>
      <p>20:16 And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.</p>
      <p>20:17 And if a man shall take his sister, his father&rsquo;s daughter, or his mother&rsquo;s daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister&rsquo;s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.</p>
      <p>20:18 And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.</p>
      <p>20:19 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother&rsquo;s sister, nor of thy father&rsquo;s sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.</p>
      <p>20:20 And if a man shall lie with his uncle&rsquo;s wife, he hath uncovered his uncle&rsquo;s nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.</p>
      <p>20:21 And if a man shall take his brother&rsquo;s wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother&rsquo;s nakedness; they shall be childless.</p>
      <p>20:22 Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out.</p>
      <p>20:23 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.</p>
      <p>20:24 But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated you from other people.</p>
      <p>20:25 Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.</p>
      <p>20:26 And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.</p>
      <p>20:27 A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them.</p>

      <p>21:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people:</p>
      <p>21:2 But for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother.</p>
      <p>21:3 And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had no husband; for her may he be defiled.</p>
      <p>21:4 But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.</p>
      <p>21:5 They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.</p>
      <p>21:6 They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.</p>
      <p>21:7 They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God.</p>
      <p>21:8 Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, am holy.</p>
      <p>21:9 And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.</p>
      <p>21:10 And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;</p>
      <p>21:11 Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;</p>
      <p>21:12 Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the LORD.</p>
      <p>21:13 And he shall take a wife in her virginity.</p>
      <p>21:14 A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife.</p>
      <p>21:15 Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the LORD do sanctify him.</p>
      <p>21:16 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>21:17 Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.</p>
      <p>21:18 For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous,</p>
      <p>21:19 Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,</p>
      <p>21:20 Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;</p>
      <p>21:21 No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.</p>
      <p>21:22 He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.</p>
      <p>21:23 Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them.</p>
      <p>21:24 And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.</p>

      <p>22:2 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me: I am the LORD.</p>
      <p>22:3 Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.</p>
      <p>22:4 What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;</p>
      <p>22:5 Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;</p>
      <p>22:6 The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.</p>
      <p>22:7 And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food.</p>
      <p>22:8 That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith; I am the LORD.</p>
      <p>22:9 They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them.</p>
      <p>22:10 There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.</p>
      <p>22:11 But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.</p>
      <p>22:12 If the priest&rsquo;s daughter also be married unto a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things.</p>
      <p>22:13 But if the priest&rsquo;s daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father&rsquo;s house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father&rsquo;s meat: but there shall be no stranger eat thereof.</p>
      <p>22:14 And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing.</p>
      <p>22:15 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;</p>
      <p>22:16 Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.</p>
      <p>22:17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>22:18 Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering;</p>
      <p>22:19 Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.</p>
      <p>22:20 But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.</p>
      <p>22:21 And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.</p>
      <p>22:22 Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>22:23 Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.</p>
      <p>22:24 Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land.</p>
      <p>22:25 Neither from a stranger&rsquo;s hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.</p>
      <p>22:26 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>22:27 When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>22:28 And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day.</p>
      <p>22:29 And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD, offer it at your own will.</p>
      <p>22:30 On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I am the LORD.</p>
      <p>22:31 Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the LORD.</p>
      <p>22:32 Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you,</p>
      <p>22:33 That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD.</p>

      <p>23:3 Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.</p>
      <p>23:4 These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.</p>
      <p>23:5 In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD&rsquo;s passover.</p>
      <p>23:6 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.</p>
      <p>23:7 In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.</p>
      <p>23:8 But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.</p>

      <p>23:10 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:</p>
      <p>23:11 And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.</p>
      <p>23:12 And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>23:13 And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of an hin.</p>
      <p>23:14 And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</p>
      <p>23:15 And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete:</p>
      <p>23:16 Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>23:17 Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>23:18 And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>23:19 Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.</p>
      <p>23:20 And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.</p>
      <p>23:21 And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.</p>
      <p>23:22 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the LORD your God.</p>
      <p>23:23 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>

      <p>23:25 Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>23:26 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>

      <p>23:30 And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.</p>
      <p>23:31 Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</p>
      <p>23:32 It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.</p>
      <p>23:33 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>23:34 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>23:35 On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.</p>
      <p>23:36 Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a solemn assembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein.</p>
      <p>23:37 These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day:</p>
      <p>23:38 Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>23:39 Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath.</p>
      <p>23:40 And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.</p>
      <p>23:41 And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month.</p>
      <p>23:42 Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths:</p>
      <p>23:43 That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.</p>
      <p>23:44 And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD.</p>

      <p>24:11 And the Israelitish woman&rsquo;s son blasphemed the name of the Lord, and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother&rsquo;s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)</p>
      <p>24:12 And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them.</p>
      <p>24:13 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>24:14 Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.</p>
      <p>24:15 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.</p>
      <p>24:16 And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.</p>
      <p>24:17 And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.</p>
      <p>24:18 And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.</p>
      <p>24:19 And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him;</p>
      <p>24:20 Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again.</p>
      <p>24:21 And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death.</p>
      <p>24:22 Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God.</p>
      <p>24:23 And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>

      <p>25:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,</p>
      <p>25:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>25:3 Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;</p>
      <p>25:4 But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.</p>
      <p>25:5 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a year of rest unto the land.</p>
      <p>25:6 And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee.</p>
      <p>25:7 And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.</p>
      <p>25:8 And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.</p>
      <p>25:9 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.</p>
      <p>25:10 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.</p>
      <p>25:11 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed.</p>
      <p>25:12 For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.</p>
      <p>25:13 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession.</p>
      <p>25:14 And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour&rsquo;s hand, ye shall not oppress one another:</p>
      <p>25:15 According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:</p>
      <p>25:16 According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.</p>
      <p>25:17 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God:for I am the LORD your God.</p>
      <p>25:18 Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.</p>
      <p>25:19 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.</p>
      <p>25:20 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:</p>
      <p>25:21 Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.</p>
      <p>25:22 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store.</p>
      <p>25:23 The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.</p>
      <p>25:24 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.</p>
      <p>25:25 If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.</p>
      <p>25:26 And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;</p>
      <p>25:27 Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.</p>
      <p>25:28 But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.</p>
      <p>25:29 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it.</p>
      <p>25:30 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile.</p>
      <p>25:31 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.</p>
      <p>25:32 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.</p>
      <p>25:33 And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.</p>
      <p>25:34 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.</p>
      <p>25:35 And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.</p>
      <p>25:36 Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.</p>
      <p>25:37 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.</p>
      <p>25:38 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.</p>
      <p>25:39 And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:</p>
      <p>25:40 But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile.</p>
      <p>25:41 And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.</p>
      <p>25:42 For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.</p>
      <p>25:43 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.</p>
      <p>25:44 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.</p>
      <p>25:45 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.</p>
      <p>25:46 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.</p>
      <p>25:47 And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger&rsquo;s family:</p>
      <p>25:48 After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:</p>
      <p>25:49 Either his uncle, or his uncle&rsquo;s son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.</p>
      <p>25:50 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.</p>
      <p>25:51 If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.</p>
      <p>25:52 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.</p>
      <p>25:53 And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.</p>
      <p>25:54 And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.</p>
      <p>25:55 For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.</p>

      <p>26:1 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God.</p>
      <p>26:2 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.</p>
      <p>26:3 If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;</p>
      <p>26:4 Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.</p>
      <p>26:5 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.</p>
      <p>26:6 And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.</p>
      <p>26:7 And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.</p>
      <p>26:8 And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.</p>
      <p>26:9 For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.</p>
      <p>26:10 And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.</p>
      <p>26:11 And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.</p>
      <p>26:12 And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.</p>
      <p>26:13 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.</p>
      <p>26:14 But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;</p>
      <p>26:15 And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant:</p>
      <p>26:16 I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.</p>
      <p>26:17 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.</p>
      <p>26:18 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.</p>
      <p>26:19 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:</p>
      <p>26:20 And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.</p>
      <p>26:21 And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.</p>
      <p>26:22 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate.</p>
      <p>26:23 And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;</p>
      <p>26:24 Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.</p>
      <p>26:25 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.</p>
      <p>26:26 And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.</p>
      <p>26:27 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;</p>
      <p>26:28 Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.</p>
      <p>26:29 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.</p>
      <p>26:30 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.</p>
      <p>26:31 And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.</p>
      <p>26:32 And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.</p>
      <p>26:33 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.</p>
      <p>26:34 Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies&rsquo; land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.</p>
      <p>26:35 As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.</p>
      <p>26:36 And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.</p>
      <p>26:37 And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.</p>
      <p>26:38 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.</p>
      <p>26:39 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies&rsquo; lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.</p>
      <p>26:40 If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;</p>
      <p>26:41 And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:</p>
      <p>26:42 Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.</p>
      <p>26:43 The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.</p>
      <p>26:44 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God.</p>
      <p>26:45 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.</p>
      <p>26:46 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.</p>

      <p>27:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>27:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation.</p>
      <p>27:3 And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.</p>
      <p>27:4 And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.</p>
      <p>27:5 And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</p>
      <p>27:6 And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.</p>
      <p>27:7 And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</p>
      <p>27:8 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.</p>
      <p>27:9 And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.</p>
      <p>27:10 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.</p>
      <p>27:11 And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest:</p>
      <p>27:12 And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.</p>
      <p>27:13 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation.</p>
      <p>27:14 And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.</p>
      <p>27:15 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.</p>
      <p>27:16 And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.</p>
      <p>27:17 If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand.</p>
      <p>27:18 But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.</p>
      <p>27:19 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.</p>
      <p>27:20 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.</p>
      <p>27:21 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest&rsquo;s.</p>
      <p>27:22 And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;</p>
      <p>27:23 Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>27:24 In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.</p>
      <p>27:25 And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</p>
      <p>27:26 Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD&rsquo;s firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the LORD&rsquo;s.</p>
      <p>27:27 And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.</p>
      <p>27:28 Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>27:29 None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.</p>
      <p>27:30 And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD&rsquo;s: it is holy unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>27:31 And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.</p>
      <p>27:32 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>27:33 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.</p>
      <p>27:34 These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.</p>

      <p>1:1 These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.</p>
      <p>1:2 (There are eleven days&rsquo; journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.) </p>
      <p>1:3 And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;</p>
      <p>1:4 After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:</p>
      <p>1:5 On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,</p>
      <p>1:6 The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:</p>
      <p>1:7 Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.</p>
      <p>1:8 Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.</p>
      <p>1:9 And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:</p>
      <p>1:10 The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</p>
      <p>1:11 (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!) </p>
      <p>1:12 How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?</p>
      <p>1:13 Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.</p>
      <p>1:14 And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.</p>
      <p>1:15 So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.</p>
      <p>1:16 And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.</p>
      <p>1:17 Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God&rsquo;s: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.</p>
      <p>1:18 And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.</p>
      <p>1:19 And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.</p>
      <p>1:20 And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.</p>
      <p>1:21 Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.</p>
      <p>1:22 And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.</p>
      <p>1:23 And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:</p>
      <p>1:24 And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.</p>
      <p>1:25 And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.</p>
      <p>1:26 Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:</p>
      <p>1:27 And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</p>
      <p>1:28 Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.</p>
      <p>1:29 Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.</p>
      <p>1:30 The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;</p>
      <p>1:31 And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.</p>
      <p>1:32 Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,</p>
      <p>1:33 Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.</p>
      <p>1:34 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,</p>
      <p>1:35 Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers.</p>
      <p>1:36 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.</p>
      <p>1:37 Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.</p>
      <p>1:38 But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</p>
      <p>1:39 Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.</p>
      <p>1:40 But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</p>
      <p>1:41 Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us.</p>
      <p> And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.</p>
      <p> 1:42 And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.</p>
      <p>1:43 So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.</p>
      <p>1:44 And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.</p>
      <p>1:45 And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</p>
      <p>1:46 So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.</p>

      <p>2:1 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.</p>
      <p>2:2 And the LORD spake unto me, saying,</p>
      <p>2:3 Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.</p>
      <p>2:4 And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:</p>
      <p>2:5 Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.</p>
      <p>2:6 Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.</p>
      <p>2:7 For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.</p>
      <p>2:8 And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</p>
      <p>2:9 And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.</p>
      <p>2:10 The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;</p>
      <p>2:11 Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims.</p>
      <p>2:12 The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.</p>
      <p>2:13 Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.</p>
      <p>2:14 And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.</p>
      <p>2:15 For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.</p>
      <p>2:16 So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,</p>
      <p>2:17 That the LORD spake unto me, saying,</p>
      <p>2:18 Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:</p>
      <p>2:19 And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.</p>
      <p>2:20 (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;</p>
      <p>2:21 A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:</p>
      <p>2:22 As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:</p>
      <p>2:23 And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.) </p>
      <p>2:24 Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.</p>
      <p>2:25 This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.</p>
      <p>2:26 And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</p>
      <p>2:27 Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.</p>
      <p>2:28 Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;</p>
      <p>2:29 (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.</p>
      <p>2:30 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.</p>
      <p>2:31 And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.</p>
      <p>2:32 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.</p>
      <p>2:33 And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.</p>
      <p>2:34 And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:</p>
      <p>2:35 Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.</p>
      <p>2:36 From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:</p>
      <p>2:37 Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.</p>

      <p>3:1 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</p>
      <p>3:2 And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.</p>
      <p>3:3 So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.</p>
      <p>3:4 And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</p>
      <p>3:5 All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.</p>
      <p>3:6 And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.</p>
      <p>3:7 But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.</p>
      <p>3:8 And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;</p>
      <p>3:9 (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)</p>
      <p>3:10 All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</p>
      <p>3:11 For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.</p>
      <p>3:12 And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.</p>
      <p>3:13 And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.</p>
      <p>3:14 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.</p>
      <p>3:15 And I gave Gilead unto Machir.</p>
      <p>3:16 And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;</p>
      <p>3:17 The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.</p>
      <p>3:18 And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.</p>
      <p>3:19 But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;</p>
      <p>3:20 Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.</p>
      <p>3:21 And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.</p>
      <p>3:22 Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.</p>
      <p>3:23 And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,</p>
      <p>3:24 O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might? </p>
      <p>3:25 I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.</p>
      <p>3:26 But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.</p>
      <p>3:27 Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.</p>
      <p>3:28 But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.</p>
      <p>3:29 So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.</p>

      <p>4:5 Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.</p>
      <p>4:6 Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.</p>
      <p>4:7 For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for? </p>
      <p>4:8 And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day? </p>
      <p>4:9 Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons&rsquo; sons;</p>
      <p>4:10 Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.</p>
      <p>4:11 And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.</p>
      <p>4:12 And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.</p>
      <p>4:13 And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.</p>
      <p>4:14 And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.</p>
      <p>4:15 Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:</p>
      <p>4:16 Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,</p>
      <p>4:17 The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,</p>
      <p>4:18 The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:</p>
      <p>4:19 And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.</p>
      <p>4:20 But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day.</p>
      <p>4:21 Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:</p>
      <p>4:22 But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.</p>
      <p>4:23 Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.</p>
      <p>4:24 For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.</p>
      <p>4:25 When thou shalt beget children, and children&rsquo;s children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger:</p>
      <p>4:26 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.</p>
      <p>4:27 And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you.</p>
      <p>4:28 And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men&rsquo;s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.</p>
      <p>4:29 But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.</p>
      <p>4:30 When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;</p>
      <p>4:31 (For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.</p>
      <p>4:32 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it? </p>
      <p>4:33 Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live? </p>
      <p>4:34 Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?</p>
      <p>4:35 Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he is God; there is none else beside him.</p>
      <p>4:36 Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.</p>
      <p>4:37 And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;</p>
      <p>4:38 To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day.</p>
      <p>4:39 Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.</p>
      <p>4:40 Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.</p>
      <p>4:41 Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;</p>
      <p>4:42 That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:</p>
      <p>4:43 Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.</p>
      <p>4:44 And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:</p>
      <p>4:45 These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt.</p>
      <p>4:46 On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt:</p>
      <p>4:47 And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;</p>
      <p>4:48 From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Hermon,</p>
      <p>4:49 And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.</p>

      <p>5:1 And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.</p>
      <p>5:2 The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.</p>
      <p>5:3 The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.</p>
      <p>5:4 The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire,</p>
      <p>5:5 (I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,</p>
      <p>5:6 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.</p>
      <p>5:7 Thou shalt have none other gods before me.</p>
      <p>5:8 Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth:</p>
      <p>5:9 Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,</p>
      <p>5:10 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.</p>
      <p>5:11 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</p>
      <p>5:12 Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee.</p>
      <p>5:13 Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:</p>
      <p>5:14 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.</p>
      <p>5:15 And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.</p>
      <p>5:16 Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</p>
      <p>5:17 Thou shalt not kill.</p>
      <p>5:18 Neither shalt thou commit adultery.</p>
      <p>5:19 Neither shalt thou steal.</p>
      <p>5:20 Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.</p>
      <p>5:21 Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour&rsquo;s wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour&rsquo;s house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbour&rsquo;s.</p>
      <p>5:22 These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.</p>
      <p>5:23 And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;</p>
      <p>5:24 And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth.</p>
      <p>5:25 Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.</p>
      <p>5:26 For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived? </p>
      <p>5:27 Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it.</p>
      <p>5:28 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken.</p>
      <p>5:29 O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever! </p>
      <p>5:30 Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.</p>
      <p>5:31 But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.</p>
      <p>5:32 Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.</p>
      <p>5:33 Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.</p>

      <p>6:1 Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it:</p>
      <p>6:2 That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son&rsquo;s son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.</p>
      <p>6:3 Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey.</p>
      <p>6:4 Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:</p>
      <p>6:5 And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.</p>
      <p>6:6 And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:</p>
      <p>6:7 And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.</p>
      <p>6:8 And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.</p>
      <p>6:9 And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.</p>
      <p>6:10 And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not,</p>
      <p>6:11 And houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full;</p>
      <p>6:12 Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.</p>
      <p>6:13 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name.</p>
      <p>6:14 Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which are round about you;</p>
      <p>6:15 (For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth.</p>
      <p>6:16 Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in Massah.</p>
      <p>6:17 Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.</p>
      <p>6:18 And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers.</p>
      <p>6:19 To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath spoken.</p>
      <p>6:20 And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God hath commanded you? </p>
      <p>6:21 Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh&rsquo;s bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:</p>
      <p>6:22 And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes:</p>
      <p>6:23 And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.</p>
      <p>6:24 And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day.</p>
      <p>6:25 And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us.</p>

      <p>7:1 When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;</p>
      <p>7:2 And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:</p>
      <p>7:3 Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.</p>
      <p>7:4 For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.</p>
      <p>7:5 But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.</p>
      <p>7:6 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.</p>
      <p>7:7 The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people:</p>
      <p>7:8 But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.</p>
      <p>7:9 Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;</p>
      <p>7:10 And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.</p>
      <p>7:11 Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.</p>
      <p>7:12 Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:</p>
      <p>7:13 And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.</p>
      <p>7:14 Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.</p>
      <p>7:15 And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.</p>
      <p>7:16 And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.</p>
      <p>7:17 If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them? </p>
      <p>7:18 Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;</p>
      <p>7:19 The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.</p>
      <p>7:20 Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.</p>
      <p>7:21 Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is among you, a mighty God and terrible.</p>
      <p>7:22 And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.</p>
      <p>7:23 But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.</p>
      <p>7:24 And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.</p>
      <p>7:25 The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therin: for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God.</p>
      <p>7:26 Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.</p>

      <p>8:1 All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers.</p>
      <p>8:2 And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.</p>
      <p>8:3 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.</p>
      <p>8:4 Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.</p>
      <p>8:5 Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.</p>
      <p>8:6 Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.</p>
      <p>8:7 For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;</p>
      <p>8:8 A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;</p>
      <p>8:9 A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.</p>
      <p>8:10 When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.</p>
      <p>8:11 Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day:</p>
      <p>8:12 Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein;</p>
      <p>8:13 And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;</p>
      <p>8:14 Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;</p>
      <p>8:15 Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;</p>
      <p>8:16 Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;</p>
      <p>8:17 And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.</p>
      <p>8:18 But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.</p>
      <p>8:19 And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.</p>
      <p>8:20 As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the LORD your God.</p>

      <p>9:1 Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,</p>
      <p>9:2 A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the children of Anak! </p>
      <p>9:3 Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.</p>
      <p>9:4 Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.</p>
      <p>9:5 Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</p>
      <p>9:6 Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people.</p>
      <p>9:7 Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.</p>
      <p>9:8 Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.</p>
      <p>9:9 When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:</p>
      <p>9:10 And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.</p>
      <p>9:11 And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.</p>
      <p>9:12 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.</p>
      <p>9:13 Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:</p>
      <p>9:14 Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.</p>
      <p>9:15 So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.</p>
      <p>9:16 And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.</p>
      <p>9:17 And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.</p>
      <p>9:18 And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.</p>
      <p>9:19 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.</p>
      <p>9:20 And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.</p>
      <p>9:21 And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.</p>
      <p>9:22 And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.</p>
      <p>9:23 Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.</p>
      <p>9:24 Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.</p>
      <p>9:25 Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.</p>
      <p>9:26 I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</p>
      <p>9:27 Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:</p>
      <p>9:28 Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.</p>
      <p>9:29 Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.</p>

      <p>10:1 At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.</p>
      <p>10:2 And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.</p>
      <p>10:3 And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand.</p>
      <p>10:4 And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me.</p>
      <p>10:5 And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.</p>
      <p>10:6 And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest&rsquo;s office in his stead.</p>
      <p>10:7 From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.</p>
      <p>10:8 At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.</p>
      <p>10:9 Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him.</p>
      <p>10:10 And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy thee.</p>
      <p>10:11 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.</p>
      <p>10:12 And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,</p>
      <p>10:13 To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good? </p>
      <p>10:14 Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD&rsquo;s thy God, the earth also, with all that therein is.</p>
      <p>10:15 Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day.</p>
      <p>10:16 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.</p>
      <p>10:17 For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward:</p>
      <p>10:18 He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.</p>
      <p>10:19 Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>10:20 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.</p>
      <p>10:21 He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.</p>
      <p>10:22 Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.</p>

      <p>11:1 Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.</p>
      <p>11:2 And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,</p>
      <p>11:3 And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;</p>
      <p>11:4 And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day;</p>
      <p>11:5 And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place;</p>
      <p>11:6 And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:</p>
      <p>11:7 But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.</p>
      <p>11:8 Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it;</p>
      <p>11:9 And that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey.</p>
      <p>11:10 For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs:</p>
      <p>11:11 But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:</p>
      <p>11:12 A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.</p>
      <p>11:13 And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,</p>
      <p>11:14 That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.</p>
      <p>11:15 And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.</p>
      <p>11:16 Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;</p>
      <p>11:17 And then the LORD&rsquo;s wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.</p>
      <p>11:18 Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.</p>
      <p>11:19 And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.</p>
      <p>11:20 And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates:</p>
      <p>11:21 That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.</p>
      <p>11:22 For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;</p>
      <p>11:23 Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.</p>
      <p>11:24 Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.</p>
      <p>11:25 There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.</p>
      <p>11:26 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;</p>
      <p>11:27 A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day:</p>
      <p>11:28 And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.</p>
      <p>11:29 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.</p>
      <p>11:30 Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh? </p>
      <p>11:31 For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.</p>
      <p>11:32 And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day.</p>

      <p>12:1 These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.</p>
      <p>12:2 Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:</p>
      <p>12:3 And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.</p>
      <p>12:4 Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.</p>
      <p>12:5 But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come:</p>
      <p>12:6 And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks:</p>
      <p>12:7 And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.</p>
      <p>12:8 Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.</p>
      <p>12:9 For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God giveth you.</p>
      <p>12:10 But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety;</p>
      <p>12:11 Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD:</p>
      <p>12:12 And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you.</p>
      <p>12:13 Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest:</p>
      <p>12:14 But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.</p>
      <p>12:15 Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.</p>
      <p>12:16 Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water.</p>
      <p>12:17 Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand:</p>
      <p>12:18 But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto.</p>
      <p>12:19 Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth.</p>
      <p>12:20 When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.</p>
      <p>12:21 If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.</p>
      <p>12:22 Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.</p>
      <p>12:23 Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.</p>
      <p>12:24 Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water.</p>
      <p>12:25 Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD.</p>
      <p>12:26 Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose:</p>
      <p>12:27 And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh.</p>
      <p>12:28 Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God.</p>
      <p>12:29 When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land;</p>
      <p>12:30 Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.</p>
      <p>12:31 Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.</p>
      <p>12:32 What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.</p>

      <p>13:13 Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;</p>
      <p>13:14 Then shalt thou enquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought among you;</p>
      <p>13:15 Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.</p>
      <p>13:16 And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again.</p>
      <p>13:17 And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and shew thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;</p>
      <p>13:18 When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God.</p>

      <p>14:1 Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.</p>
      <p>14:2 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the LORD hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all the nations that are upon the earth.</p>
      <p>14:3 Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.</p>
      <p>14:4 These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,</p>
      <p>14:5 The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.</p>
      <p>14:6 And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft into two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall eat.</p>
      <p>14:7 Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore they are unclean unto you.</p>
      <p>14:8 And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase.</p>
      <p>14:9 These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat:</p>
      <p>14:10 And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it is unclean unto you.</p>
      <p>14:11 Of all clean birds ye shall eat.</p>
      <p>14:12 But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,</p>
      <p>14:13 And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind,</p>
      <p>14:14 And every raven after his kind,</p>
      <p>14:15 And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,</p>
      <p>14:16 The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan,</p>
      <p>14:17 And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant,</p>
      <p>14:18 And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.</p>
      <p>14:19 And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you: they shall not be eaten.</p>
      <p>14:20 But of all clean fowls ye may eat.</p>
      <p>14:21 Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself: thou shalt give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God.</p>
      <p> Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother&rsquo;s milk.</p>
      <p> 14:22 Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field bringeth forth year by year.</p>
      <p>14:23 And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always.</p>
      <p>14:24 And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the LORD thy God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:</p>
      <p>14:25 Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose:</p>
      <p>14:26 And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household,</p>
      <p>14:27 And the Levite that is within thy gates; thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee.</p>
      <p>14:28 At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates:</p>
      <p>14:29 And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest.</p>

      <p>15:2 And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD&rsquo;s release.</p>
      <p>15:3 Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release;</p>
      <p>15:4 Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it:</p>
      <p>15:5 Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day.</p>
      <p>15:6 For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.</p>
      <p>15:7 If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother:</p>
      <p>15:8 But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.</p>
      <p>15:9 Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against thee, and it be sin unto thee.</p>
      <p>15:10 Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto.</p>
      <p>15:11 For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.</p>
      <p>15:12 And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee.</p>
      <p>15:13 And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty:</p>
      <p>15:14 Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress: of that wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.</p>
      <p>15:15 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing to day.</p>
      <p>15:16 And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee;</p>
      <p>15:17 Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust it through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise.</p>
      <p>15:18 It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee, in serving thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest.</p>
      <p>15:19 All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep.</p>
      <p>15:20 Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household.</p>
      <p>15:21 And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind, or have any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy God.</p>
      <p>15:22 Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.</p>
      <p>15:23 Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water.</p>

      <p>16:2 Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there.</p>
      <p>16:3 Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.</p>
      <p>16:4 And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.</p>

      <p>16:14 And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates.</p>
      <p>16:15 Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.</p>
      <p>16:16 Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the LORD empty:</p>

      <p>16:19 Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons, neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.</p>

      <p>17:15 Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the LORD thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy brother.</p>
      <p>17:16 But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.</p>

      <p>19:9 If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, beside these three:</p>
      <p>19:10 That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee.</p>
      <p>19:11 But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleeth into one of these cities:</p>
      <p>19:12 Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.</p>
      <p>19:13 Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.</p>
      <p>19:14 Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour&rsquo;s landmark, which they of old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.</p>
      <p>19:15 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.</p>
      <p>19:16 If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong;</p>
      <p>19:17 Then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges, which shall be in those days;</p>
      <p>19:18 And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely against his brother;</p>
      <p>19:19 Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you.</p>
      <p>19:20 And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you.</p>
      <p>19:21 And thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.</p>

      <p>20:1 When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the LORD thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>20:2 And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people,</p>
      <p>20:3 And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them;</p>
      <p>20:4 For the LORD your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.</p>
      <p>20:5 And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.</p>
      <p>20:6 And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not yet eaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it.</p>
      <p>20:7 And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.</p>
      <p>20:8 And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren&rsquo;s heart faint as well as his heart.</p>
      <p>20:9 And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.</p>
      <p>20:10 When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it.</p>
      <p>20:11 And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.</p>
      <p>20:12 And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:</p>
      <p>20:13 And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword:</p>
      <p>20:14 But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.</p>
      <p>20:15 Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.</p>
      <p>20:16 But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth:</p>
      <p>20:17 But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:</p>
      <p>20:18 That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the LORD your God.</p>
      <p>20:19 When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man&rsquo;s life) to employ them in the siege:</p>
      <p>20:20 Only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued.</p>

      <p>21:1 If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath slain him:</p>
      <p>21:2 Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain:</p>
      <p>21:3 And it shall be, that the city which is next unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke;</p>
      <p>21:4 And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer&rsquo;s neck there in the valley:</p>
      <p>21:5 And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried:</p>
      <p>21:6 And all the elders of that city, that are next unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley:</p>
      <p>21:7 And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.</p>
      <p>21:8 Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel&rsquo;s charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them.</p>
      <p>21:9 So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD.</p>
      <p>21:10 When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive,</p>
      <p>21:11 And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife;</p>
      <p>21:12 Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house, and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails;</p>
      <p>21:13 And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.</p>
      <p>21:14 And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her.</p>
      <p>21:15 If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated:</p>
      <p>21:16 Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, which is indeed the firstborn:</p>
      <p>21:17 But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.</p>
      <p>21:18 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:</p>
      <p>21:19 Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;</p>
      <p>21:20 And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.</p>
      <p>21:21 And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.</p>
      <p>21:22 And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:</p>
      <p>21:23 His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.</p>

      <p>22:2 And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him again.</p>
      <p>22:3 In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother&rsquo;s, which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise: thou mayest not hide thyself.</p>
      <p>22:4 Thou shalt not see thy brother&rsquo;s ass or his ox fall down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again.</p>
      <p>22:5 The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman&rsquo;s garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God.</p>
      <p>22:6 If a bird&rsquo;s nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree, or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young:</p>
      <p>22:7 But thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young to thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days.</p>
      <p>22:8 When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine house, if any man fall from thence.</p>
      <p>22:9 Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, be defiled.</p>
      <p>22:10 Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.</p>

      <p>22:14 And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid:</p>
      <p>22:15 Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel&rsquo;s virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate:</p>
      <p>22:16 And the damsel&rsquo;s father shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her;</p>
      <p>22:17 And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech against her, saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter&rsquo;s virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.</p>
      <p>22:18 And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;</p>
      <p>22:19 And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.</p>
      <p>22:20 But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel:</p>
      <p>22:21 Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father&rsquo;s house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father&rsquo;s house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you.</p>
      <p>22:22 If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel.</p>
      <p>22:23 If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;</p>
      <p>22:24 Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour&rsquo;s wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you.</p>
      <p>22:25 But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die.</p>
      <p>22:26 But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter:</p>
      <p>22:27 For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her.</p>
      <p>22:28 If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;</p>
      <p>22:29 Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel&rsquo;s father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.</p>
      <p>22:30 A man shall not take his father&rsquo;s wife, nor discover his father&rsquo;s skirt.</p>

      <p>25:1 If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked.</p>
      <p>25:2 And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number.</p>
      <p>25:3 Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother should seem vile unto thee.</p>
      <p>25:4 Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn.</p>
      <p>25:5 If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband&rsquo;s brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband&rsquo;s brother unto her.</p>
      <p>25:6 And it shall be, that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his name be not put out of Israel.</p>
      <p>25:7 And if the man like not to take his brother&rsquo;s wife, then let his brother&rsquo;s wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband&rsquo;s brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband&rsquo;s brother.</p>
      <p>25:8 Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her;</p>
      <p>25:9 Then shall his brother&rsquo;s wife come unto him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother&rsquo;s house.</p>
      <p>25:10 And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that hath his shoe loosed.</p>
      <p>25:11 When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets:</p>
      <p>25:12 Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity her.</p>
      <p>25:13 Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small.</p>
      <p>25:14 Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and a small.</p>
      <p>25:15 But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</p>
      <p>25:16 For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto the LORD thy God.</p>
      <p>25:17 Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were come forth out of Egypt;</p>
      <p>25:18 How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God.</p>
      <p>25:19 Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget it.</p>

      <p>26:1 And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it, and dwellest therein;</p>
      <p>26:2 That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name there.</p>
      <p>26:3 And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto the LORD thy God, that I am come unto the country which the LORD sware unto our fathers for to give us.</p>
      <p>26:4 And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and set it down before the altar of the LORD thy God.</p>
      <p>26:5 And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous:</p>
      <p>26:6 And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage:</p>
      <p>26:7 And when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers, the LORD heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labour, and our oppression:</p>
      <p>26:8 And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders:</p>
      <p>26:9 And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, even a land that floweth with milk and honey.</p>
      <p>26:10 And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land, which thou, O LORD, hast given me. And thou shalt set it before the LORD thy God, and worship before the LORD thy God:</p>
      <p>26:11 And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thine house, thou, and the Levite, and the stranger that is among you.</p>
      <p>26:12 When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and hast given it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled;</p>
      <p>26:13 Then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God, I have brought away the hallowed things out of mine house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have not transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them.</p>
      <p>26:14 I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought thereof for the dead: but I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God, and have done according to all that thou hast commanded me.</p>
      <p>26:15 Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou swarest unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey.</p>
      <p>26:16 This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.</p>
      <p>26:17 Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his voice:</p>
      <p>26:18 And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments;</p>
      <p>26:19 And to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honour; and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the LORD thy God, as he hath spoken.</p>

      <p>27:3 And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou art passed over, that thou mayest go in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, a land that floweth with milk and honey; as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee.</p>
      <p>27:4 Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan, that ye shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaister them with plaister.</p>
      <p>27:5 And there shalt thou build an altar unto the LORD thy God, an altar of stones: thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them.</p>
      <p>27:6 Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones: and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD thy God:</p>
      <p>27:7 And thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, and rejoice before the LORD thy God.</p>
      <p>27:8 And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly.</p>
      <p>27:9 And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel, saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art become the people of the LORD thy God.</p>
      <p>27:10 Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God, and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command thee this day.</p>

      <p>27:13 And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.</p>
      <p>27:14 And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice,</p>
      <p>27:15 Cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image, an abomination unto the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and putteth it in a secret place. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen.</p>
      <p>27:16 Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
      <p>27:17 Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour&rsquo;s landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
      <p>27:18 Cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
      <p>27:19 Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>

      <p>28:1 And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth:</p>
      <p>28:2 And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God.</p>
      <p>28:3 Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field.</p>
      <p>28:4 Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.</p>
      <p>28:5 Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store.</p>
      <p>28:6 Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out.</p>
      <p>28:7 The LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face: they shall come out against thee one way, and flee before thee seven ways.</p>
      <p>28:8 The LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses, and in all that thou settest thine hand unto; and he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</p>
      <p>28:9 The LORD shall establish thee an holy people unto himself, as he hath sworn unto thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, and walk in his ways.</p>
      <p>28:10 And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of thee.</p>
      <p>28:11 And the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers to give thee.</p>
      <p>28:12 The LORD shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven to give the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all the work of thine hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, and thou shalt not borrow.</p>
      <p>28:13 And the LORD shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God, which I command thee this day, to observe and to do them:</p>
      <p>28:14 And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.</p>
      <p>28:15 But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee:</p>
      <p>28:16 Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field.</p>
      <p>28:17 Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store.</p>
      <p>28:18 Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.</p>
      <p>28:19 Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out.</p>
      <p>28:20 The LORD shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do, until thou be destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the wickedness of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me.</p>
      <p>28:21 The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he have consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest to possess it.</p>
      <p>28:22 The LORD shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee until thou perish.</p>
      <p>28:23 And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is under thee shall be iron.</p>
      <p>28:24 The LORD shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed.</p>
      <p>28:25 The LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies: thou shalt go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them: and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.</p>
      <p>28:26 And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and unto the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray them away.</p>
      <p>28:27 The LORD will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not be healed.</p>
      <p>28:28 The LORD shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart:</p>
      <p>28:29 And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man shall save thee.</p>
      <p>28:30 Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes thereof.</p>
      <p>28:31 Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof: thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to rescue them.</p>
      <p>28:32 Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people, and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day long; and there shall be no might in thine hand.</p>
      <p>28:33 The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway:</p>
      <p>28:34 So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.</p>
      <p>28:35 The LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head.</p>
      <p>28:36 The LORD shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone.</p>
      <p>28:37 And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee.</p>
      <p>28:38 Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather but little in; for the locust shall consume it.</p>
      <p>28:39 Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but shalt neither drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat them.</p>
      <p>28:40 Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast his fruit.</p>
      <p>28:41 Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy them; for they shall go into captivity.</p>
      <p>28:42 All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume.</p>
      <p>28:43 The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high; and thou shalt come down very low.</p>
      <p>28:44 He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.</p>
      <p>28:45 Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee:</p>
      <p>28:46 And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever.</p>
      <p>28:47 Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;</p>
      <p>28:48 Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.</p>
      <p>28:49 The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand;</p>
      <p>28:50 A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor shew favour to the young:</p>
      <p>28:51 And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land, until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee either corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee.</p>
      <p>28:52 And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.</p>
      <p>28:53 And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee:</p>
      <p>28:54 So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave:</p>
      <p>28:55 So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates.</p>
      <p>28:56 The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,</p>
      <p>28:57 And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.</p>
      <p>28:58 If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;</p>
      <p>28:59 Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.</p>
      <p>28:60 Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.</p>
      <p>28:61 Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.</p>
      <p>28:62 And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD thy God.</p>
      <p>28:63 And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it.</p>
      <p>28:64 And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone.</p>
      <p>28:65 And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:</p>
      <p>28:66 And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:</p>
      <p>28:67 In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.</p>
      <p>28:68 And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.</p>

      <p>29:8 And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.</p>
      <p>29:9 Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.</p>
      <p>29:10 Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of Israel,</p>
      <p>29:11 Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water:</p>
      <p>29:12 That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy God, and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this day:</p>
      <p>29:13 That he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</p>
      <p>29:14 Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;</p>
      <p>29:15 But with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day:</p>
      <p>29:16</p>
      <p>(For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by;</p>
      <p>29:17 And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)</p>
      <p>29:18 Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;</p>
      <p>29:19 And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst:</p>
      <p>29:20 The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven.</p>
      <p>29:21 And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law:</p>
      <p>29:22 So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it;</p>
      <p>29:23 And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:</p>
      <p>29:24 Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger? </p>
      <p>29:25 Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt:</p>
      <p>29:26 For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:</p>
      <p>29:27 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:</p>
      <p>29:28 And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day.</p>
      <p>29:29 The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.</p>

      <p>30:1 And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath driven thee,</p>
      <p>30:2 And shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul;</p>
      <p>30:3 That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee.</p>
      <p>30:4 If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:</p>
      <p>30:5 And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.</p>
      <p>30:6 And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.</p>
      <p>30:7 And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.</p>
      <p>30:8 And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day.</p>
      <p>30:9 And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good: for the LORD will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers:</p>
      <p>30:10 If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law, and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.</p>
      <p>30:11 For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off.</p>
      <p>30:12 It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? </p>
      <p>30:13 Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? </p>
      <p>30:14 But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.</p>
      <p>30:15 See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;</p>
      <p>30:16 In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.</p>
      <p>30:17 But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;</p>
      <p>30:18 I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.</p>
      <p>30:19 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:</p>
      <p>30:20 That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.</p>

      <p>31:1 And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.</p>
      <p>31:2 And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.</p>
      <p>31:3 The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them: and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath said.</p>
      <p>31:4 And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed.</p>
      <p>31:5 And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you.</p>
      <p>31:6 Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</p>
      <p>31:7 And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.</p>
      <p>31:8 And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.</p>
      <p>31:9 And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel.</p>
      <p>31:10 And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,</p>
      <p>31:11 When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.</p>
      <p>31:12 Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law:</p>
      <p>31:13 And that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.</p>
      <p>31:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
      <p>31:15 And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.</p>
      <p>31:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.</p>
      <p>31:17 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God is not among us? </p>
      <p>31:18 And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.</p>
      <p>31:19 Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.</p>
      <p>31:20 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.</p>
      <p>31:21 And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.</p>
      <p>31:22 Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.</p>
      <p>31:23 And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.</p>
      <p>31:24 And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,</p>
      <p>31:25 That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,</p>
      <p>31:26 Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.</p>
      <p>31:27 For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death? </p>
      <p>31:28 Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.</p>
      <p>31:29 For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.</p>
      <p>31:30 And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended.</p>

      <p>32:1 Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.</p>
      <p>32:2 My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass:</p>
      <p>32:3 Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye greatness unto our God.</p>
      <p>32:4 He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.</p>
      <p>32:5 They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.</p>
      <p>32:6 Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee? </p>
      <p>32:7 Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.</p>
      <p>32:8 When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.</p>
      <p>32:9 For the LORD&rsquo;s portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.</p>
      <p>32:10 He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.</p>
      <p>32:11 As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:</p>
      <p>32:12 So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.</p>
      <p>32:13 He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;</p>
      <p>32:14 Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.</p>
      <p>32:15 But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.</p>
      <p>32:16 They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.</p>
      <p>32:17 They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.</p>
      <p>32:18 Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.</p>
      <p>32:19 And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.</p>
      <p>32:20 And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.</p>
      <p>32:21 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.</p>
      <p>32:22 For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.</p>
      <p>32:23 I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.</p>
      <p>32:24 They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.</p>
      <p>32:25 The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.</p>
      <p>32:26 I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:</p>
      <p>32:27 Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all this.</p>
      <p>32:28 For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.</p>
      <p>32:29 O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end! </p>
      <p>32:30 How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up? </p>
      <p>32:31 For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.</p>
      <p>32:32 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:</p>
      <p>32:33 Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.</p>
      <p>32:34 Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures? </p>
      <p>32:35 To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.</p>
      <p>32:36 For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.</p>
      <p>32:37 And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,</p>
      <p>32:38 Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.</p>
      <p>32:39 See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.</p>
      <p>32:40 For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.</p>
      <p>32:41 If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.</p>
      <p>32:42 I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.</p>
      <p>32:43 Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.</p>
      <p>32:44 And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.</p>
      <p>32:45 And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:</p>
      <p>32:46 And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.</p>
      <p>32:47 For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.</p>
      <p>32:48 And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,</p>
      <p>32:49 Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:</p>
      <p>32:50 And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:</p>
      <p>32:51 Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.</p>
      <p>32:52 Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.</p>

      <p>33:1 And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.</p>
      <p>33:2 And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.</p>
      <p>33:3 Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words.</p>
      <p>33:4 Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.</p>
      <p>33:5 And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together.</p>
      <p>33:6 Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.</p>
      <p>33:7 And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies.</p>
      <p>33:8 And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;</p>
      <p>33:9 Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.</p>
      <p>33:10 They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.</p>
      <p>33:11 Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands; smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.</p>
      <p>33:12 And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.</p>
      <p>33:13 And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath,</p>
      <p>33:14 And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon,</p>
      <p>33:15 And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,</p>
      <p>33:16 And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren.</p>
      <p>33:17 His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.</p>
      <p>33:18 And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents.</p>
      <p>33:19 They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.</p>
      <p>33:20 And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.</p>
      <p>33:21 And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel.</p>
      <p>33:22 And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion&rsquo;s whelp: he shall leap from Bashan.</p>
      <p>33:23 And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and the south.</p>
      <p>33:24 And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.</p>
      <p>33:25 Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy strength be.</p>
      <p>33:26 There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.</p>
      <p>33:27 The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.</p>
      <p>33:28 Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew.</p>
      <p>33:29 Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.</p>

      <p>34:1 And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,</p>
      <p>34:2 And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,</p>
      <p>34:3 And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.</p>
      <p>34:4 And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.</p>
      <p>34:5 So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.</p>
      <p>34:6 And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.</p>
      <p>34:7 And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.</p>
      <p>34:8 And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.</p>
      <p>34:9 And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
      <p>34:10 And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,</p>
      <p>34:11 In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,</p>
      <p>34:12 And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel.</p>
